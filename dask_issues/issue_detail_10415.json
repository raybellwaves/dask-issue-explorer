For example, the multiprocessing and threaded schedulers each take a num_workers keyword, which sets the number of processes or threads to use (defaults to number of cores). This can be set by passing the keyword when calling compute:\r\n\r\nThere is no link signposting where to find out keywords that different schedulers support however, and I'm struggling to find that information by searching the docs. It would be great to add a link to the scheduler API docs here (which I'm also strugging to find!).",
