    "body": "As mentioned in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9345#issuecomment-1207863896, we currently unpack `dataclass`es to discover embedded Dask collections. However, the support for `dataclass`es is limited: \r\n\r\n>[W]e basically want to be able to unpack those `dataclass`es that do not have any custom `__init__`, `__post_init__`, feature fields with `init=False`, or use `InitVars`. Those `dataclass`es should ideally not be mutated, at the very least not here and mutation would likely create a host of problems down the line. \r\n\r\nIn #9361, we add support for unpacking `namedtuple`, which seem to be a perfect match to the limited scope of functionality we want to support in unpacking `dataclass`es. They are immutable and have a trivial, unchangeable constructor that consists of all their fields with optional defaults.\r\n\r\nDeprecating the unpacking of `dataclass`es in favor of `namedtuple` would give us a smooth way to remove traversal of `dataclass`es as mentioned in https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/6574#issuecomment-943411814 and help us get rid of a few issues: \r\n* Unclear boundary of support for unpacking `dataclass`es (e.g., unset `init=False` fields are fine, set `init=False` fields are not)\r\n* Flawed detection of un-supported `dataclass`es (i.e., detecting a custom `__init__` will likely remain imperfect)\r\n* #5533\r\n* Conceptually, this entire feature feels odd given the mutable nature of `dataclass`es\r\n\r\nTo deprecate unpacking of `dataclass`es, we can use the existing logic for unpacking to issue the `DeprecationWarning` whenever an embedded collection is detected.",
