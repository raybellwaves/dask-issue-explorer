So I might as well add the reflect_type=\"odd\". \r\n\r\nHow do you generally see readability vs performance?\r\n\r\nThe numpy project first pads the array with empty values and then more or less recursively fills the array with the correct values. We could do something similar where we recursively pad multiple times. This would probably result into clean code, but since we're reshaping the array multiple times, could lead to worse performance.",
