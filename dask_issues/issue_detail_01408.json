    "body": "HDF format is probably the most mature cross-platform format in common use today for pandas-like data.  Dask.dataframe supports this format through `dd.to_hdf` and `dd.read_hdf` functions, which are decently full featured.  \n\nHowever, as various features have glommed onto `read_hdf` it has become fairly complex, causing significant maintenance burden and additional friction when adding new features.  As we think about naturally supporting intelligent partitioning (see #1407), a new and important feature, we might also consider how `read_hdf` might be rewritten from scratch to improve both the existing situation and ease future development.\n\nIt would be nice to now collect both some current frustrations and some long-term desires for dealing with dask.dataframe and HDF files together so that future designs can have these in mind. \n\ncc @nirizr @alberthdev\n",
