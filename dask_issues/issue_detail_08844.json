    "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nUsing the `axes` argument of `dask.array.apply_gufunc` produces unexpected behavior. I have a few seemingly distinct examples, but I will focus on the simplest one. The attached MCVE is supposed to reduce the core dimension (axis 0), hence the custom function `sum_axis_0` reduces this axis, however, the array block passed to `sum_axis_0` by `apply_gufunc` is transposed, hence leading to summing over the wrong axis. \r\n\r\nWhen I briefly looked over the source code, I see that the arrays are very deliberately transposed, hence my expectation may simply be wrong.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\nThe following example is supposed to reduce the core dimension (0)\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\n\r\ndef sum_axis_0(array):\r\n    return array.sum(0)\r\n\r\narray = da.zeros((5, 5), chunks=(5,1))\r\n\r\nsignature = '(i)->()'\r\n\r\naxes = [0]\r\n\r\nout = da.apply_gufunc(\r\n    sum_axis_0,\r\n    signature,\r\n    array,\r\n    axes=axes,\r\n)\r\n\r\nprint('dask array shape (as expected):', out.shape) \r\nprint('computed array shape (unexpected):', out.compute().shape)\r\n```\r\nproducing the following output\r\n```\r\ndask array shape (as expected): (5,)\r\ncomputed array shape (unexpected): (25,)\r\n```",
