    "body": "More of a discussion prompt than anything else: the [new](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/) `breakpoint()` functionality got me thinking about how it might be used to facilitate debugging dask workflows. For local dask code it's maybe easy enough already to switch to the synchronous scheduler and use pdb directly, but for distributed code especially it can be quite cumbersome. Maybe something in the vein of [launching IPython](http://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipython.html#launch-ipython-within-dask-workers) could be called on breakpoint and block until debugging is finished?",
