If I want to avoid warnings (e.g. because an unexpected warning will cause my job to fail) then I need to special case num_workers=1 or decorate all of my code with filterwarnings where I might get a warning from this behavior (which means that I need to tell dask twice that I want to use 1 worker).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion warnings should only appear when something is wrong and requires human intervention.",

Is there a reason the single-threaded scheduler would not work in those cases?\r\n\r\nThe single-threaded scheduler would work, but if I want to write a function that scales from 1 cpu to n cpus on one machine then, with the warning above, the way to accomplish this is to either manually disable the warning, modify the code to run something like:\r\n```\r\nif num_workers==1\r\n  ... use single threaded scheduler ...\r\nelse:\r\n  ... use threaded scheduler ...\r\n```\r\nor live with the warning (which may not be possible in a production environment). Either solution seems rather ugly.\r\n\r\nAlso for existing code that uses the threads scheduler with num_workers=1 with a future release that includes this patch dask will start throwing warnings. This can mean that someone will need to update the code with a snippet above (and possibly that they will be woken up to do so). For deprecations this is very important as the code will at some point stop working, but for existing code that was developed with a particular valid use case it seems overbearing.\r\n\r\nI do see your point on how this and other performance warnings can be useful for code that is undergoing active development, however. Maybe a palatable suggestion would be to include such warnings, but add a config option to dask that allows ignoring of various warnings (e.g. ignored_warnings = PerformanceWarning)? Another solution might be to log a debug message?\r\n\r\nThanks for engaging on this!",

After reading through the comments above though, I think I'm now against adding a warning at all. I could see the benefit of a debug log message though when the scheduler starts up. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"dask.local\")\r\nlogger.debug(\"Using threaded scheduler with %d threads\", num_workers)\r\n```\r\n\r\nat the start of `dask.threaded.get`/`dask.multiprocessing.get`/`dask.local.get_sync` (adjusting the message for each scheduler accordingly).",
