    "body": "I suspect that we will often want to use tsqr with unknown chunk sizes, which occur whenever someone converts a dask dataframe into a dask array (dataframes don't maintain chunk sizes).   Currently we don't recurse in these situations.  Maybe we should though.  \r\n\r\nA few options:\r\n\r\n1.  We do know the chunk size in the columns dimension.  We also have an understanding of what an OK chunk size is in `dask.config.get('array.chunk-size')`.  Is this sufficient?\r\n2.  We might just recurse every 10 or 100 chunks or so, regardless of size",
