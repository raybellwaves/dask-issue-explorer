    "body": "NumPy may allow `where=array_like` to also dispatch when given to a NumPy ufunc.  This would mean that if `where=array_like` implements `__array_ufunc__`, NumPy would try dispatching to it in the future.  (Currently only input and output array-likes dispatch).\r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns, please just let us know.  The use-case is relatively specific:  An uncertainty array-like.  It makes sense to have `where=boolean_uncertainty` promote the result to also be an uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe PR in NumPy is https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23240\r\n\r\nThe probability of anything breaking seems very low.  You need to pass a non-compatible object into `where=` to trigger even potential issues.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, the only change would be that dask would add a check for `kwargs[\"where\"]` being supported.\r\n\r\nCC @mmccarty",
