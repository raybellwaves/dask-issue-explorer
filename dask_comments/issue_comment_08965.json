It looks like `from_delayed` is one of the fuse-roots applications that you were curious about (`optimize_blockwise` doesn't capture `Delayed` dependencies, but `fuse_roots` does).  I don't think there is any reason to call `cull` again after `fuse_roots`, but I certainly don't understand the optimization completely :)",
