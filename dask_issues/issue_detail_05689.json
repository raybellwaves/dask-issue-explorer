    "body": "I am trying to add Dask support to `astropy.io.fits` and because it's such a lovely file format FITS is big endian on disk, so before I can `.store()` the data to the file I need to byteswap the array.\r\n\r\nWhat I have currently done which seems to work is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        @delayed\r\n        def _byteswap(arr):\r\n            return np.array(arr).byteswap(True).newbyteorder(\"S\")\r\n\r\n        return dask.array.from_delayed(_byteswap(array), shape=array.shape,\r\n                                       dtype=array.dtype.newbyteorder(\"S\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich appears to work but is somewhat weird.\r\n\r\nI was wondering what would be involved in adding `.byteswap` to `Array` [this](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/1647#issuecomment-252945402) seems to suggest it wouldn't be that hard, but I wouldn't know where to start.",
