        "body": "Yeah this issue has been raised a few times. Personally would agree with you that the default for locking here no longer makes sense. Distributed has some lock objects that are friendly to use in a cluster environment. Maybe we could use one of those?\n\nThe counterargument to this has usually been we want users to think about whether what they are doing makes sense in a distributed environment before choosing that lock. However I suspect most users today (like yourself) have a pretty good handle on what the differences are and we should pick a default that does not cause unnecessary confusion.",
