        "body": "since I wrote `blackdoc` while testing with `xarray`'s examples it has been pretty smooth (though as with `black` the first PR might be big).\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember, the only notable \"hiccup\" so far was that we used f-strings to construct examples (there's a script in `xarray` that generates a code). We worked around that by explicitly telling `pre-commit` to not run `blackdoc` on the script itself, which is fine because we can just run it on the generated module.\r\n\r\nOther than that there's the common issue of `pre-commit` only updating the hook environment if the hook itself is updated. Since `blackdoc` depends on `black`, that means that the version of `black` used by `blackdoc` might differ from the one used by the `black` hook. We can work around that by pinning the version of `black` using `additional_dependencies`, and I've provided a (still experimental) hook in `blackdoc` (`blackdoc-autoupdate-black`) that keeps both versions in sync.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try running it on the code base of `dask` feel free to ping me with any issues / questions you might have.",
