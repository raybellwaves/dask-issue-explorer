Definitely agree the current description of `reduction` could be improved.\r\n\r\n> it should be able to not instantiate the input dask array (?). ie does the reduction function of np. only work because of __array_function__ dispatch? Or am I missing some other magic here?\r\n\r\nIIUC I think the magic is that this `coarsen` function is only applied to chunks of the Dask array. The top-level `dask.array.coarsen` function is defined here\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/6d639d2cfc9acc365ab90dea453c87c38e7c4edb/dask/array/routines.py#L2301-L2330\r\n\r\nand contains the Dask-specific logic ",

So are the requirements then:\r\n\r\n- the first argument should be an array (of the same type as the base array of the dask array?)\r\n- it should also take an `axis=` argument of type `Tuple[int]` to specify the axes along which the reduction should happen.\r\n\r\nThat's it, right?",
