Usually used when code is in github and not in artifactory. But the code is pip installable, so this could be a combination of UplaodDirectory and PipInstall, which the user will have to create it.\r\n\r\n@phobson you mentioned you have some other user requests, let's start a conversation about what do we need and what's the best way to present it.
