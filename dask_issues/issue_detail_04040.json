We're probably over-saturating some resource on the GPU that wasn't designed for concurrency.  That being said, I'm curious what the best way to handle operations like this is.  I *do* have a few GPUs on this box, and probably each of these tasks is too small to saturate one of them.\r\n\r\n@seibert @sklam I'd be curious to get your take on handling performance here.  Can you recommend reading that explains how I should think about concurrency on top of these things?",
