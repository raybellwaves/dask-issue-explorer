Would you also be able to share the complete error traceback?\r\n\r\n@MrPowers was looking into running the groupby queries with Dask, and AFAICT the [queries on the 5GB dataset didn't cause issues](https://github.com/coiled/coiled-resources/tree/main/benchmarks). cc @ncclementi and @ian-r-rose who have more background on this.\r\n\r\nYou may also find #9292 interesting. :)",
