    "body": "Reductions with `axis=()` are a special set of reductions where little if any work needs to be done. It might be valuable to optimizes these. Here's a few classes of results that are seen by looking at NumPy.\r\n\r\nWith statistical reductions like `a.mean(axis=())`, passing `axis=()` results in a no-op. It would be nice in these cases to return the Dask Array unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe `nan*` equivalent operations are nearly the same, but swap out all `nan` values for `0`s leaving the rest of the array unchanged. These might benefit from a simple application of `da.nan_to_num`.\r\n\r\nOTOH reductions like `a.var(axis=())` and `a.std(axis=())` return an array full of `0`s. Similarly these would be nice to optimize out to avoid unnecessary computation. Currently they raise exceptions ( https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/4996 ).\r\n\r\nFor `bool` style reductions like `any` and `all`. These return a result equivalent to `a != 0`.",
