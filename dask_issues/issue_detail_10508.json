It would be good to be more generic here and just talk about IB. cc @pentschev in case you have thoughts\r\n\r\nI also haven't added a GPU section, but it might be useful to folks and we could talk at a high level and then direct them to RAPIDS docs for this. Wanted to check with folks like @mrocklin, @jrbourbeau, @fjetter before doing this. I can always add this in a follow up.\r\n\r\ncc @kmpaul for dask-mpi",
