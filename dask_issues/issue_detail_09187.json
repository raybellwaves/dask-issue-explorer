    "body": "**Current situation**\r\nPortions of the `dask.dataframe` API are copied over directly from `pandas` using the `@derived_from` decorator. This pulls in the pandas docstring for the corresponding object and adds the \"This docstring was copied from pandas. Some inconsistencies with the Dask version may exist.\"\r\n\r\n**Problem** \r\nNew users often find the vagueness in this docstring confusing and intimidating -- Are there really inconsistencies? How many of them? What are they?\r\n\r\n**Proposed Situation**\r\n- Adopt a standardised method for reporting known inconsistencies. I've made a first attempt in #9177  - this format is very much open to discussion.\r\n- Launch an organised effort to comb through the `dask.dataframe` API systematically to report known inconsistencies wherever possible. I'm not really sure what the best way to do this would be - perhaps a meta-issue or item in the overall Dask project board (if that exists?)\r\n\r\nThis process could be replicated for `dask.array`\r\n\r\n",
