        "body": "So I hadn't seen the comment from @martindurant but my ideas on this align pretty much with what he suggests: to expose the rechunking through string arguments to the existing rechunk method.  The other rechunking method I would consider adding is to be able to optimise for a given gufunc by ensuring single-chunk core dimensions. In general it would likely be sensible to implement in a way which provides a mechanism for registration of custom rechunking functions which take the current chunk layout and return the desired one.\r\n\r\nWhen I started using Dask the biggest issue for me was what chunking to choose.  I have finally got the hang of it but for new users I think this is still an issue.  The 'auto' keyword is a great step but I think it can definitely be extended like this.  \r\nThere are likely some good efficiency gains to be had by helping users chunk their data correctly from the start.  If I can tell da.from_array that I am intending to apply `some_gufunc()` to my data when I load it, then it potentially avoids costly rechunks after loading.\r\n\r\nI think this is mostly parallel to the discussion on automatic rechunking, as I think that is more of a discussion about when to rechunk rather than how.",
