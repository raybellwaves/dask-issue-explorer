    "body": "Ruff is a new linter written in Rust. \r\n\r\nRuff is actively developed and would enable us to replace a bunch of different pre-commit hooks with ruff. pandas moved over a couple of months ago and we are quite happy with ruff. They are adding new rules constantly, so chances are high that we will be able to replace more stuff as time goes on. We could get rid of a couple of third party extensions like ``absolufy-imports``.\r\n\r\nThe readme explains most of the important things:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff\r\n\r\ncc @jrbourbeau @fjetter @crusaderky @graingert ",
