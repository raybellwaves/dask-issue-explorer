Wait for PyPI solution and then use it ( https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/pull/7071 )\r\n2. Watch [conda-forge feedstock]( https://github.com/conda-forge/dask-feedstock ) for updates\r\n3. Use a 3rd party service like [libraries.io]( https://libraries.io/pypi/dask ) to get this info\r\n4. Maybe Anaconda has a solution here?\r\n\r\nWe could add steps to our release process like marking a release as final on the GitHub web API. Additional automation like James mentions could be reasonable here. Though my guess is we don't strictly need to add these for this use case (as one of the solutions above likely works).",
