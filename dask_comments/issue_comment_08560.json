        "body": "Although I\u2019d like to remove `HighLevelGraph.cull` completely in the medium-to-long term (along the lines of #9216), I do think it makes sense to address the outstanding issue that: (1) `fuse_roots` materializes Blockwise layers, and (2) the specific cases that benefit from `fuse_roots` are poorly understood and not even captured by CI.\r\n\r\nI spent some time exploring `fuse_roots` myself, and I think I agree that the optimization should probably come *after* the `\"optimization.fuse.active\u201d` bailout, because it is indeed materializing the graph for the purpose of low-level fusion. Also, most of the cases it is designed to target should be covered by Blockwise IO or general low-level fusion.\r\n\r\nOne case where `fuse_roots` **is** currently important is `dask.dataframe`\u2019s  `from_delayed`.  With that said, I don\u2019t see any reason why we couldn\u2019t implement a simpler delayed-specific optimization for this (one that doesn\u2019t materialize the target Blockwise Layer).\r\n",
