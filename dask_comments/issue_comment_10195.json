        "body": "I found that converting the output from your predict function to numpy seemed to fix the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nreturn np.array(classifier.predict(features=features, image = image))\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not sure why that is happening. I wonder if it has something to do with the fact your input dask array contains numpy chunks, so it may also be expecting your function to provide numpy array output.\r\n\r\nWe've done a little experimenting with cupy-backed dask arrays, but zero experimenting supporting clesperanto-backed dask arrays so far.
