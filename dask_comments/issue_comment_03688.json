        "body": "> I'm not entirely sure how to integrate it into CI. Do you have thoughts? One option would be a simple text / JSON file somewhere in the repo with a list of known / OK differences, and if a difference is detected that isn't on that list then CI fails?\r\n\r\nYes. Something like that sounds like the right approach. I would probably go with JSON/YAML in case we need a bit more metadata per difference.\r\n\r\n> Do you mean a docs page that list \"differences between pandas & dask\"?\r\n\r\nYes, that was my original idea, but maybe it makes more sense to just finish out https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/1815\r\n",
