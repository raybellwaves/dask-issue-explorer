    "body": "We've been working on moving high level graphs directly to the scheduler.  This should significantly reduce overhead when submitting large graphs.  So far our benchmark workloads have been dataframe workloads.  We should diversify.  \r\n\r\nThe other main group that often speaks up about task scheduling overhead is the Xarray/Pangeo group, which also handles very large graphs.  It would be useful to establish a workload to optimize that is both representative of task-overhead-sensitive workloads and also simple and easy to run on a laptop or distributed system (we may only see some things when running at scale).  \r\n\r\ncc @rabernat if you can point folks to something simple\r\n\r\ncc @ian-r-rose this might be an interesting topic for you to engage on.
