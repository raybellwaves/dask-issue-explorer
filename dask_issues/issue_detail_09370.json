    "body": "As mentioned in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9345#discussion_r940533164, `dask.compute` can't handle some `dataclass`es as inputs due to a limitation in `dask.base.unpack_collections`. In #9345, we added support or error handling for these types of `dataclass`es, but the implementation of `dask.base.unpack_collections` makes it non-trivial to apply those changes. Specifically, we experience issues as soon as we encounter a custom `__init__`, `__post_init__`, fields with `init=False` or `InitVar`s in the `dataclass`. #9363 would provide an alternative route to solving this issue. \r\n\r\n```python3\r\nimport dask\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass MyDataClass:\r\n    arg1: int\r\n    def __init__(self, arg):\r\n        self.arg1 = arg\r\n        \r\ndask.compute([dask.delayed(1), MyDataClass(1)])\r\n```",
