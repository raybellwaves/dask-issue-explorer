    "body": "Dask.dataframe resampling operations proceed in two steps:\r\n\r\n1.  Collect partitions together, including some potential overlap\r\n2.  Perform the normal Pandas resampling operation\r\n\r\nThis works fine.  However, when we're using resample to downsample intelligently (which seems to be a common case) then step 1 might collect *a lot* of data onto single machines before any downsampling occurs.  It might be possible to downsample *some* data, move around some boundaries, downsample those as well, and then concat all of the smaller pieces of data together.",
