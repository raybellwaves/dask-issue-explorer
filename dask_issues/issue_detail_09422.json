    "body": "- [x] Closes #9331 and #9122\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n\r\nThis PR prevents building frames with duplicate column names, raising a `ValueError` and informing about the duplicities. \r\n\r\nTo do so, it relies on a new internal method `DataFrame._prevent_dupl_col_names()` which is invoked by the `__init__` method. This internal method has an `allow_index_name_in_cols` flag that controls whether the index is indeed allowed to have the same name as a column, or whether this is also forbidden. \r\n\r\nBy default it IS allowed, because some join methods in `dataframe.multi` rely on this. However, when called by `from_pandas`, it is called with `False`, because it is assumed that if your Pandas dataframe index has a name, that's because it was originally a column; eventually you could reset that index to be again a column, and things should keep on working (see this [related discussion ](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/9380)).\r\n\r\nNOTE 1: because this is called during construction, it also works when trying to rename columns, either via `ddf.rename(columns=new_columns)` or BY setting columns directly via `ddf.columns = new_columns`. Explicit tests were added to check the `ValueError` is raised when duplicities occur as a result of renaming.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2: there were some tests that explicitly tested what happens with column name duplicity. I followed this approach:\r\n* If the test was exclusively intended to check behavior with duplicate columns, that test now `XFAILs` with the explicit message `dataframe does no longer support duplicate column names`.\r\n* If the test only checked duplicate columns as a marginal case, either I deleted that particular check, or I eliminated duplicities by using unique column names, so the test keeps on working.\r\n\r\nNOTE 3: I also added some missing annotations that don't cause any conflicts with `mypy` and for which I was fairly sure what type hints to use.",
