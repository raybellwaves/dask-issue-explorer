        "body": "Hi @anandjeyahar \n\nThe functions that back `dask/dataframe/utils.py::meta_nonempty` might be a good start to look for dtypes.\n\nTwo approaches come to mind:\n\n### Make a pandas function and then reapply it to dask.dataframe\n1.  Make a good function for Pandas dataframes that uses things like min, max, nunique.  This should be easier to test and get right in the simple case.\n2.  Try to reuse that same function for dask.dataframes\n\n### Make a pandas function and then combine the results\n1.  Make a good function for Pandas dataframes as above\n2.  Make a function that takes two sets of dtypes and unifies them to a common denominator.  This would rely pretty heavily on numpy coercion rules like the following:\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: import numpy as np\nIn [2]: (np.empty(shape=0, dtype='i4') + np.empty(shape=0, dtype='u2')).dtype\nOut[2]: dtype('int32')\n```\n\n### Starting point\n\nIn either case I would start by doing this for Pandas.  A very simple first test might be something like the following:\n\n``` python\nIn [4]: df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': ['a', 'b', 'c']})\n\nIn [5]: df.dtypes\nOut[5]: \nx     int64\ny    object\ndtype: object\n\n\n>>> compressed_dtypes(df)\nx     uint8\ny    object\ndtype: object\n```\n",
