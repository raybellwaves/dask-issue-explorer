Otherwise it's like doing the same computation twice (first to get the chunks and second to compute the array)\r\n\r\n> ...and I have limited bandwidth to take on this one.\r\n\r\nI think that is the general sentiment here\r\n\r\nIf matching NumPy's order is not too important for you, would suggest looking at this ( https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/4855#issuecomment-497062002 ). It may not work out-of-the-box, but probably with a little tinkering it could be useful for getting past this issue",
