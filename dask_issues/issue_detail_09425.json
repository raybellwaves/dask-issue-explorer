Groupby could become just a `map_partitions` in that case https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8361, and [`merge` already is internally](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/57ff5c2e9c550e3c76592b0affa0d45e88375e12/dask/dataframe/multi.py#L381-L390).\r\n\r\nWhat if we had another parameter like `divisions`, which tracked which column(s)/index a DataFrame was sorted by, if any?\r\n* If `df.known_divisions`, then `df.partitioned_by` would always be known\r\n* If `df.partitioned_by`, `df.divisions` might still be unknown. This would be the case after any shuffle-based operation, namely a merge.\r\n\r\nThen methods like `groupby` and `merge` could take advantage of this information to offer embarrassingly-parallel paths in these cases.\r\n\r\nI know that maintaining divisions for multiple columns has been discussed before, but this seems like a much easier change to make initially, since we wouldn't be changing the meaning of current `divisions`. We could add the field, then add support for it in other methods gradually.\r\n\r\ncc @ian-r-rose @jsignell @rjzamora @jrbourbeau\r\n\r\nVery related to:\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/6246 (somewhat the same as this)\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/1493",
