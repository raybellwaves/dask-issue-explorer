Would this just be a simple wrapper around pandas using from_map on pd.read_excel?\r\n\r\nYes I believe so; I would imagine a `dask.dataframe.read_excel` function to be implemented by passing `pd.read_excel` to `from_map`\r\n\r\n> I took a look at io/json.py and it seems to be fairly complex, with chunking/flattening/etc.\r\n\r\nYou can start with what is the simplest case and build from there; just reading in a list of excel files and creating a dataframe that is one partition per file. For example if you have 3 files (`file{1,2,3}.xlsx`), I think it would be good to start with something like (I haven't tested this):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom dask.dataframe.io.io import from_map\r\n\r\ndef read_excel(inputs, **kwargs):\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n\r\n    return from_map(pd.read_excel, inputs, **kwargs)\r\n\r\n\r\nfiles = [\"file1.xlsx\", \"file2.xlsx\", \"file3.xlsx\"]\r\n# will assign `dd` a Dask DataFrame with 3 partitions (one for each file).\r\ndd = read_excel(files)\r\n\r\n# would also work (all partitions would be created by reading `mysheet` in each file)\r\ndd = read_excel(files, sheet_name=\"mysheet\")\r\n```\r\n",
