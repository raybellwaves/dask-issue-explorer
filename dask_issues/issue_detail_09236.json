Since the utility does more than \"warn\", I changed the name to `handle_dtype_mismatch`\r\n\r\nThe motivation for the \"auto casting\" improvement is cudf/dask_cudf: While Pandas' hashing utility (`pd.util.hash_pandas_object`) will produce consistent results for differing precisions (e.g. int32 vs int64), cudf will not be consistent.  Although the dtype-mismatch warning means it should be up to the user to cast join keys explicitly, it seems reasonable to handle the simple case that both columns are numpy integer dtypes (where casting rules are simple).
