        "body": "Thanks @talkhanz. Adding a `da.fill_diagonal` method would be welcome. \r\n\r\n> Any pointers on how I could go about implementing this on my own would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nUsing `map_blocks` could work here. I think we'd want to map a function that makes use of the `block_info=` or `block_id=` functionality described in the [`map_blocks` docstring](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.array.map_blocks.html#dask.array.map_blocks) to determine if we're on the diagonal or not. For non-diagonal blocks, don't do anything. For diagonal blocks, fill with the specified fill value. ",

Although I'm not sure what is the best place in this case. Maybe in add it `dask/array/tests/test_array_core.py)`, @jrbourbeau is this the right place? \r\n\r\n> btw np.fill_diagonal fills the diagonal in place i.e the original array is changed\r\n\r\nThis is interesting, I'm not sure what will happen to the test in this case since `dx` does a `from_array` and if `x` get's modified in place that might be modified `dx` too. I'd suggest you push any code that you have, so we can help you based on the code. : )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
