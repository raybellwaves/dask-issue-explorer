It's terrible, but I did promise Ian and Gabe I would try to write *something*. \r\n\r\nI think the most helpful ideas from it are:\r\n1. A focus on converting existing Dask functionality (I expect more people will be doing this, compared to creating entirely new functionality with high level graphs - at least at this stage of maturity)\r\n2. Explaining where the code should live, and how to find the right places\r\n3. Trying to focus on how you can do the development work incrementally. \r\n    - Rick's document above is much, much better, but it is extremely hard to go from zero to 200-ish lines of code in step 2. Maybe separating out what is boilerplate code that can be copied over from somewhere, vs code you *must* implement, vs the nice to have code you *could* implement (like the `_dict` caching) would help.\r\n    - \"Trying\" is the operative word here this is really hard to do because there is so much boilerplate, and because you need to implement several things at once before you can test them. Then if there is a problem, there's too many places to look and possible interactions between methods and it's hard to figure out what you did wrong. (I think Gabe suggested that if there were a more robust contract, where it was clear what the inputs and outputs of methods should be then it might become easier to test them in isolation)\r\n",

        "body": "Circling back to the original comment on this thread:\r\n\r\n> I just came across [this page of the docs](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/high-level-graphs.html) which hasn't been changed much since Dec 2018. I think it would be useful to update it to include a runnable example and some information about the `Layer` class.\r\n\r\nI had a look at what would need to happen to make the code example runnable. I tried to change as little as possible about the example for this experiment, although we may find another type of example that could work better.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that jump out:\r\n1. Example data generation\r\n2. Small changes needed so the code does not produce errors\r\n3. Differences in terminology between layer names in example text vs runnable code.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Example data generation\r\nThis is the first hurdle for making the example actually runnable.\r\n\r\nThe example seemed closest to the accounts example datasets created and used in the [dask-tutorial](https://github.com/dask/dask-tutorial). To generate those csv files, we need the files `prep.py`, `accounts.py`, and `sources.py` from the tutorial repo.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Small changes needed so the code does not produce errors\r\nThese are generally easy enough to work around.\r\n\r\nLines like `df = df + 100` don't work for dataframes including string columns, like the `names` column. That can be changed to something like `df = df['amount'] + 100`.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Difference in terminology between layer names\r\nThis potentially negatively affects the clarity of the documentation. For that reason, I think this is the biggest problem out of the three.\r\n\r\nIn the current docs, \"filter\" is used and is very clearly understandable. In a runnable example, we get a combination of `getitem`, `eq` (and sometimes `try-loc`, depending on what the exact computation is). This is likely to be a lot more confusing for people, because we've moved away from having one name for the filter operation.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that number 3 would be less of a problem with a more strategically chosen example, so we should strongly consider doing that. I haven't been able to think of a really good alternative yet, ideas are welcome.\r\n",
