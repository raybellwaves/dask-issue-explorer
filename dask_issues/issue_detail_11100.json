It has tons of information that are completely irrelevant for someone who has heard the first time about Dask or just wants to run an example and play around a little bit. The information in there is mostly what I would expect from a 2nd step section.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty confusing where you should start looking if you are someone who has never done anything with Dask and seems very complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Proposal:**\r\n\r\nWe create a dedicated getting started section for the most relevant use-cases (currently we have content for bags, dataframes and arrays). They take a user through:\r\n\r\n-  Installing -> running a short example -> looking at the Dashboard -> How can I scale out\r\n\r\nDescriptions are short and on point without introducing internals or stuff that is very Dask specific. Just get them to the point where they can run something and look at it on the Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stuff that we have currently in the getting started section will be trimmed down a little and advertised as further reading (or something similar, I am not married to any of those terms).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not meant to be merged, just a proposal for a layout that we can then fill with content",
