This value is stored in the global metadata (if it exists) and stored in the footers of each file in the dataset - and therefore should require no actual data loading. The length could also be found after filtering, if that filtering is applied partition-wise (e.g., a condition on one of the columns inferred from the directory structure).\r\n\r\nObviously, such an enhancement would have *no benefit* after any filtering (or merge, etc.) that depends on the data itself and is only useful as far as the row count can ever be useful.",
