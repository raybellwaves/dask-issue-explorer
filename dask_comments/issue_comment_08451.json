        "body": "@rjzamora the one test that's failing is `test_shuffle_priority`, which you added in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7846. This is of course happening because of https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/7036: the priority annotations you've set in `SimpleShuffleLayer` get lost during optimization. This is very much a real failure.\r\n\r\nIf we just changed the test to use `dask.datasets.timeseries` instead of `dd.from_pandas`, it would work, because there would no longer be any materialized layers \ud83d\ude01 . Which shows just how brittle this all is!",
