    "body": "**What happened**:\r\n\r\nThe Satpy project has a travis environment that installs unstable (master branch) versions of dask, xarray, and a couple other libraries. That environment has been failing for at least a couple weeks and I finally had time to track down the issue. Something in xarray or dask master branches is causing an odd use case to return arrays with `nan` in the shape when previously they didn't. The overall use case I think is an accident in one of our unit tests (described below), but the point is that it is failing now because of some change so while I could fix our test I thought I'd make you all aware of this.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nDask should produce a known chunk size regardless of chunktype. Like I said though, this is kind of an odd use case.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport xarray as xr\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ndask_arr = da.zeros((300, 10), dtype=np.float32, chunks=(300, 10))\r\ndata_arr = xr.DataArray(dask_arr)\r\nprint(da.from_array(data_arr) == 1.7e38)\r\n\r\n# result with current dask and xarray master branches (or master of last couple weeks or months even)\r\n# dask.array<eq, shape=(nan, 0), dtype=bool, chunksize=(nan, 0), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>\r\n# result from dask 2.15.0, xarray 0.16.1\r\n# dask.array<eq, shape=(300, 10), dtype=bool, chunksize=(300, 10), chunktype=xarray.DataArray>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: See above\r\n- Python version: 3.7 and 3.8 at least\r\n- Operating System: Ubuntu/PopOS\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): conda using conda-forge\r\n",
