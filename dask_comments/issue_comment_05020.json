        "body": "To broaden this a bit I think that moderately advanced users would benefit from the various ways to extend dask collections with our internal functions.  There is some best practices documentation on this here: \r\n\r\nhttps://docs.dask.org/en/latest/best-practices.html#learn-techniques-for-customization\r\n\r\nThings like blockwise, map_blocks, gufuncs, reductions, map_overlap in arrays or map_partitions, rolling, aca, reduction in dataframes are quite useful fairly quickly in the progression of a novice user to an intermediate user.  I think that most of our more skilled users today are comfortable with these functions, but today they manage it with mostly information in the docstrings.  I suspect that if we were to construct a page for each collection with the various patterns, and invest a bit in diagrams around those patterns, that that would help us to advance beginner users to intermediate users effectively.  Personally, I would probably structure this as a page for each collection that had a section for each function that included \r\n\r\n-  Prose describing when it's useful\r\n-  A simple example (perhaps just taken from the docstring)\r\n-  A diagram (or a few) showing the structure of the computation (under various inputs)",
