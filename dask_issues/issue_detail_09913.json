    "body": "In pandas 2.0, there were a lot of changes related to `numeric_only` argument in `DataFrame` and `DataFrameGroupBy` aggs. In Dask, we followed up to implement similar behavior and ensure that clients are able to use Dask with `pandas>=2.0` without things breaking. The following PRs add or change `numeric_only` behavior to align with the changes in pandas:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9787\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9889\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9898\r\n\r\nThe support of `numeric_only` is not quite complete without also supporting some aggs on datetime-like dtypes, like this PR implements in Pandas:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/29941\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9898, with pandas 2.0, if the dataframe contains datetime-like dtype, and `numeric_only` is `False` or default, an attempt to aggregate it will raise an error. With pandas 1.5, a warning is raised, and non-numeric columns are dropped.\r\n\r\nAlso related, this PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9868\r\n\r\ncontains a workaround to not test `mean` on datetimes, because while pandas supports finding `mean` of a datetime dtype, Dask can't handle it yet.\r\n\r\nOpening this issue to add support for datetime-like dtypes.\r\n\r\ncc @jrbourbeau.",
