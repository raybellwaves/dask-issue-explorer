For the ~1k partition range, I think it's more of a UX issue than performance\u2014the 2-3 second lag at the end where nothing is moving on the dashboard, and the only progress bar left is `dataframe-count-agg 0/1`, feels awkward but doesn't slow you down substantially.\r\n\r\nIf you had 50k partitions, my guess is it might be in the 20 second range ballpark (depending on number of workers).",

My gut tells me that the `split_every` default (8) is probably not right for these small-data aggregations, but that `False` is probably wrong at large scale.
