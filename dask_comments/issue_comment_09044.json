It seems to me like we *should* move away from this, but I agree with @jrbourbeau that changing the default could cause pain for some users.  Maybe as a first pass we could just add an explicit `file_extension=\".part\"` argument? Or if we do want to set the defatult to `file_extension=\".csv\"`, we may want to add a warning on the read side if the user specifies \".part\" in a glob pattern?",

        "body": "Okay - @MrPowers and I spent some time looking into this today, and it seems that it is fsspec (and not Dask) that is currently deciding to add a `\u201d.part\u201d` file extension when the user passes `to_csv` a directory name. This is because `to_csv` currently [uses fsspec\u2019s `open_files` function](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/0492b71268a46951ccef37eb5e6e5e7a57fdde95/dask/dataframe/io/csv.py#L918) to expand a single-directory name into a list of open files.  As far as I can tell, `open_files` does **not** provide a mechanism for the user to specify a different file extension.\u2028\u2028\r\n\r\n@martindurant - Do you think it would be reasonable to *add* some kind of file-extension option to `open_files` (which would probably mean adding the same option to [get_fs_token_paths](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html?highlight=get_fs_token_paths#fsspec.core.get_fs_token_paths) (where the actual path expansion is performed)? Or- do you think `to_csv` should stop using `open_files`, and simply define the expanded file names itself?",
