I think that dd.concat is exactly that function, especially with the reliance on the dd.multi.align_partitions function, which performs much of the magic that we need here.\n",

That's probably not too high on the wishlist, though.\n\nAgreed.  This would work if we read a single file in chunks by making many single-partition dask.dataframes and then called `concat` on all of them as we do now for the `*` case.\n\n> We might want to support fixed format now, as mentioned in #1167.\n> It is now possible to save 'fixed' globstring dataframes and then load them as multiple partitions. This should be in line with dasks preference for multiple partitions\n\nAgreed that fixed with `*` now makes sense.  Good idea.\n\n> Another radical thought: If reading a slice out of a single hdf dataset is not frequently used, it might be simpler to just drop start and stop to keep read_hdf simple. Users still wishing to get a slice could use dask operations instead.\n\nI'm curious if anyone uses this.  I wouldn't be terribly surprised if a few people did although I agree that it's lower priority.\n",

        "body": "I don't think we use slicing much... though keeping sane with the API might be useful, and those who are more used to Pandas may appreciate this feature quite a bit! That said, if lazy loading is implemented in `dd.read_hdf` (I assume it is), I think using the Dask's built-in slicing should work as well. (The slice should hopefully be loaded on demand!)\n\nAnother side thought - `dd.read_hdf` (or some alternative API) should also be able to support raw HDF5 reading, e.g. a la H5py style reading. There are a lot of HDF5 files out there that do not use the Pandas format for storing data, and it would be immensely useful to have dask support these kind of raw files.\n",
