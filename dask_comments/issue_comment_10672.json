My experience is that CI that is sometimes red causes people to mostly disregard signals in CI, which causes more things to leak into CI.  dask/distributed fell into this trap when I stopped actively maintaining it and I think it has caused hundreds of hours of lost human time.  I'd be sad if dask/dask fell into this trap as well.  (although of course the concurrent nature of dask/distributed makes it harder over there than here; I'm hopeful that we can do a better job in dask/dask where it's easier).\r\n\r\n",
