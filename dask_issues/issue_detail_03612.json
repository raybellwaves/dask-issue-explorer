    "body": "A common situation that comes up with arrays is an operation applied to them may be symmetric. In these cases, we should be able to roughly half the number of tasks generated (or better for higher order symmetries), which is a pretty nice speedup. Examples of this include computation of the [Covariance matrix]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance ), [Gramian matrix]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramian_matrix ), [BLAS `syrk`]( http://cvxopt.org/userguide/blas.html#cvxopt.blas.syrk ), [BLAS `herk`]( http://cvxopt.org/userguide/blas.html#cvxopt.blas.herk ), etc. Would be nice if there was a way to inform `atop` that such an operation will be symmetric over some indices or some sets of indices so the graph can reuse tasks from one part of the array for other parts that will be the same (combined with a chunk local transpose).",
