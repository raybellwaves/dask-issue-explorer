        "body": "`ignore_index` cannot be implemented here like pandas unless we computed the input of `concat` beforeahead. There are two ways to implement `ignore_index`. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe first one is resetting the index of each `df` in `.concat_pandas` the problem with this is that the output will be like [reset_index](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.dataframe.DataFrame.reset_index.html). \r\n\r\n> Note that unlike in pandas, the reset dask.dataframe index will not be monotonically increasing from 0. Instead, it will restart at 0 for each partition (e.g. index1 = [0, ..., 10], index2 = [0, ...]). This is due to the inability to statically know the full length of the index. \r\n\r\nThe second way can happen by manipulating the index inside the `.concat` function before actually concatting. This edit will work perfectly if the user passed `pandas dataframes` to the `concat`. However, if the user passed `dask dataframe` it will need to be computed firstly to `pandas dataframe` and then converted again to `dask dataframe`.\r\n```\r\n    if kwargs['ignore_index']:\r\n        start_index = 0\r\n        for i in range(len(dfs)):\r\n            if isinstance(dfs[i], pd.DataFrame):\r\n                dfs[i].index= pd.RangeIndex(start = start_index, stop = start_index+len(dfs[i]))\r\n            if isinstance(dfs[i], _Frame):\r\n                dfs[i] = dfs[i].compute()\r\n                dfs[i].index= pd.RangeIndex(start = start_index, stop = start_index+len(dfs[i]))\r\n                dfs[i] = from_pandas(dfs[i], npartitions=1)\r\n            start_index+=len(dfs[i])\r\n```\r\n I think this solution isn't efficient or follows Dask logic. In conclusion, although it can be implemented I think implementing pandas' `ignore_index` behavior won't be aligned with Dask's logic for the same reason as implementing pandas' `reset_index` behavior.",
