    "body": "Because `fuse_roots` materializes Blockwise layers, if you have a situation where you're sub-selecting a few items out of a large initial Blockwise array, culling the graph (cheap) before materializing it (slow) can be massively more performant. As more becomes Blockwise (https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7417), this will become more relevant. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = da.from_zarr(\"s3://10-trillion-chunk-dataset/a\")\r\nb = da.from_zarr(\"s3://10-trillion-chunk-dataset/b\")\r\nmetric = a / b\r\ntiny_part = metric[:10]\r\n# Without this PR, optimizing `tiny_part` could require materializing the 10-trillion-chunk\r\n# `from_array` graphs, just to cull them down to nothing a moment later\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI doubt this is exactly correct\u2014maybe we need to cull again after `fuse_roots`? (Culling is cheap but not _that_ cheap; I'd like to not do it twice if possible.)\r\n\r\nBecause it materializes, I also think `fuse_roots` should perhaps go after the `if config.get(\"optimization.fuse.active\") is False: return dsk` bailout.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I don't understand `fuse_roots`. The situation described in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/5451#issuecomment-552983458, and the test for it, are already handled by plain Blockwise fusion. In fact, if I remove `fuse_roots` entirely, `test_fuse_roots` still passes!\r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora @ian-r-rose \r\n\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
