    "body": "Pandas 1.3 includes an experimental `string[pyarrow]` dtype that's much more memory efficient than `object` columns.\r\n\r\nRocklin [made a video on this new dtype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zoPmQ6J1aE&t=145s&ab_channel=Coiled) which shows how the `string[pyarrow]` type greatly reduced memory usage and query times.  He shows a better than 2x query speed improvement in his little notebook example with `string[pyarrow]`.  I ran some experimentation on my end and found that the `string[pyarrow]` type reduced the memory usage of an `object` column by 6.7x.\r\n\r\nThese are huge improvements and the progress is really exciting.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this issue is to brainstorm the additional work that needs to be performed to get `string[pyarrow]` out of \"experimental\" and make it generally available.  @mrocklin - can you share your thoughts on the challenges and the next steps?",
