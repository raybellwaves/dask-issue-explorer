    "body": "The documentation for the shuffle parameter in the dask.DataFrame.set_index method says:\r\n- \"Either 'disk' for single-node operation or 'tasks' for distributed operation. Will be inferred by your current scheduler.\"  \r\n\r\nCurrently, `tasks` is inferred when using the distributed scheduler regardless of cluster type.  However, given that the distributed scheduler is frequently used in a single machine context via LocalCluster, it seems like it would make sense to infer `shuffle='disk'` when used with a LocalCluster.  If that's not ideal for some reason, perhaps the dask.DataFrame.shuffle parameter documentation could be amended to say something like:\r\n- \"Either 'disk' for single-node operation or 'tasks' for distributed operation. Will be inferred by your current scheduler.  It is recommended to use 'disk'  when using LocalCluster\"  \r\n\r\nMy understanding is you wouldn't want to use `dd.DataFrame.set_index(df, shuffle='tasks')` when using LocalCluster, due to the high memory usage so this would make the default setting for this parameter more appropriate in the case when a LocalCluster is being used.",
