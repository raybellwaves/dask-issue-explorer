I wouldn't want to merge a bunch of stuff just yet (especially with Florian and Guido being out for the next few weeks (unless anyone else wants to take over the role of \"will stay up nights and weekends unbreaking things if they break\")) but things are looking good.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone feels like unearthing the serialization PR, now might be a good time.",
