    "body": "Would be nice to have a `da.apply_blocks` function that allows some stateful [UDF]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-defined_function ) to be supplied that is assumed to not return a result. From the Dask side this could be treated as returning a `Delayed` value allowing the computation to be run as needed. This is handy for things like storing different chunks to different files (e.g. TIFFs, PNGs, CSVs, etc.) or printing something (e.g. mean of each chunk).\r\n\r\ncc @d-v-b",
