Have people complained about\nit or is this something we're considering purely from a principled approach?\n\nOn Wed, Mar 1, 2023 at 1:08 PM James Bourbeau ***@***.***>\nwrote:\n\n> Currently head() and tail() trigger an implicit, immediate computation.\n> This can be surprising to users since almost all Dask methods are lazily\n> evaluated. Instead I think head() and tail() should return a Dask\n> DataFrame that users can then call compute() on like most other methods.\n>\n> Since both these methods already have a compute= keyword that is True by\n> default, I'll suggest we:\n>\n>    1. Deprecate the current compute=True default value and inform users\n>    that in the future compute= will default to False\n>    2. After a while, change the default to compute=False\n>\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/10010>, or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AACKZTGKYNFX3LN5GKZRVJTWZ6NCHANCNFSM6AAAAAAVMOE5LY>\n> .\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.Message\n> ID: ***@***.***>\n>\n",
