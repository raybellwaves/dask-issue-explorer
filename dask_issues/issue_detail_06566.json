    "body": "The current quantiles implementation is a custom algorithm with no statistical analysis behind it. It was written to support efficient partitioning of data (which doesn't require as robust statistical guarantees), but was expanded to implement the `quantiles` method. Quantiles also supports a `method='tdigest'` implementation, that is much more statistically robust, and has a proof of accuracy bounds. This doesn't support quantiles on non-numeric data though.\r\n\r\nSince users (rightfully) expect statistically sound defaults, we might want to consider switching to using `method='tdigest'` as the default for quantiles.\r\n\r\nSee #6551, #6564, #731.",
