I have a general desire to make pandas best-practices also work with dask dataframes, but it may be unrealistic to expect too much. That being said, I don't think computations like these (lots of embarrassingly parallel transformations) are particularly unusual in an ETL context, so it's a pathological case that I expect to see in the wild.",
