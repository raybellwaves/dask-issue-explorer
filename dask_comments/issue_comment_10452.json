        "body": "Thanks for the issue @jerry-kobold. I'm able to reproduce with 2023.6.0. However, there have been some fixes to our default scheduler logic since that release, which appear to fix this issue, as I'm not able to reproduce with the latest 2023.8.1 release. So if you're able to update versions, then that should fix things. \r\n\r\nIf you're not able to easily update, a temporary workaround would be to compute `mean` before handing it off to `da.full_like`. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nmean = da.nanmean(arr).compute()  # add the `.compute()` call to this line\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this update I'm not able to reproduce the error when running with 2023.6.0",
