    "body": "When doing basic statistics on a Dask Array, it is not uncommon to want to compute a few moments (or really cumulants) at the same time. For instance, one normally doesn't just want the mean, but also the variance (or standard deviation) and maybe even the skew. This means that a few moments need to be computed. Instead of constructing a graph for each of the moments need and combining them together afterwards, it would be nice to just state the range of moment orders that are needed and have a 1-D Dask Array returned with these moments in order.",
