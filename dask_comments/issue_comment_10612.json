        "body": "> Should we try to find a simple way to add a temporary deprecation warning for all APIs using split_out?\n\nI think that makes sense - it seems like we have a few unified utility functions used to check and control `shuffle`/`split_out`, maybe we can move this logic to one of those functions so we don't have to deal with the burden of adding a unique check to each relevant API?\n\n> Related question: Is there a reason that dask-sql needs to use split_out=None for now? If so, how much time do you think is needed to address the deprecation?\n\nThough I caught this in dask-sql's test suite, don't think this should require much work to address - this was just a single test asserting some behavior based on `split_out` that happened to use the old default. I'm generally okay with moving forward with the deprecation, as it has been a while, though maybe other maintainers have context on why we haven't moved forward yet (cc @jrbourbeau)\n\n",
