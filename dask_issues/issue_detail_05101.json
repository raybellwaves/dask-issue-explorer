    "body": "While trying to make the [astropy Quantity object](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/) compatible with Dask we encountered a possible interface change that might be necessary.  Specifically, it needs to be possible for `DaskArray` to access attributes on the `_meta` as though the `DaskArray` were the `_meta` - most particularly the `unit` attribute of `Quantity` and possibly similar informational methods/attributes related to the `unit`.\r\n\r\nTo enable `DaskArray`'s to work as a near- or actual drop-in, the suggested fix would then be to add/adjust `__getattr__` on `DaskArray` to look at the `_meta` and try to get attributes from there (if they aren't on `DaskArray`, although a `__getattr__` implementation means that part happens automatically).  Something like this:\r\n```\r\nclass DaskArray(...):\r\n    ...\r\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\r\n        return getattr(self._meta, name)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @mrocklin @bsipocz @astrofrog",
