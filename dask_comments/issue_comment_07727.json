FWIW I tried setting `optimization.fuse.active` as true and got the same error. \r\n\r\nPing @martindurant @rjzamora @madsbk for optimization and IO help :)",

        "body": "Hm, looking at this, I'm not certain what the right thing to do is. \r\nYou see, the user might choose to only compute part of the output array, but should this execute the whole store stage? The normal `compute=False` gives you back a single delayed object, which when computed, runs all of store. It could be done such that each stored chunk requires the whole store step, but this might end up with store being called multiple times, if all the final chunks are not computed in the same call.",
