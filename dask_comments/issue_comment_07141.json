For arrays this might be chunks and dtype, for dataframes this might be partition structure, columns, and dtypes.  \r\n\r\nDoing this is a little bit odd.  It adds information that is normally orthogonal onto the graph.  This breaks a bit of cleanliness.  It also might be an interesting step forward.  We might start using this strictly for visualization, and then later on decide that it's useful for other things, like optimization.  I don't anticipate this being deleterious in any way, assuming that when we serialize the graph that we don't bother sending this information just yet.  \r\n\r\nThis would allow us to provide much richer visualizations though, including things like column names and chunk structure for different stages in the graph.",

We currently have two different technologies for visualizing this information\r\n\r\n1.  Basic HTML table views for nbytes, dtypes, etc..\r\n2.  Our home-grown svg visualization code for chunk structure\r\n3. `dot`/graphviz for high level graph layout\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's easy to combine `dot` with custom svg images and tables, but if so, that would be grand.  If not then we might want to think about our own SVG layout for these graphs.  This would probably require some blackboard or pen-and-paper thinking.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this looks decent enough to be valuable then we might have enough motivation to include mangling the graph layers with collection metadata.  There would probably be an interesting conversation.\r\n\r\nAfter that I would probably try to nerd-snipe others to use this same information for high level graph optimizations.  One possible ~sucker~ volunteer is @rjzamora, who has been thinking about pushing down column selection through the graph.",
