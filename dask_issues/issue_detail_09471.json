    "body": "The upcoming `panads=1.5` release contains several deprecations around `pandas` use of `numeric_only` (xref https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/46560). All of these changes are backwards compatible, so user code shouldn't break, but users will start getting lots of deprecation warnings from `dask`s internal use of `pandas` (which is scattered throughout `dask.dataframe`). Ideally, `dask` would emit the same deprecation `pandas` does and users wouldn't see any deprecations due to `dask`s internal use of `pandas`. \r\n\r\nThere have been a few attempts at adding `numeric_only` compatibility to `dask` with `pandas=1.5` (https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9269, https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9271, https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9241) but, as @rhshadrach highlights in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/46560#issuecomment-1180871534, exactly what the current default value is for `numeric_only` and when a deprecation warning isn't super straightforward. \r\n\r\nOpening a dedicated issue so we don't loose track of this issue. \r\n\r\ncc @rhshadrach as he appears to be leading the `numeric_only` changes upstream in `pandas`\r\ncc @mroeschke @jorisvandenbossche in case you have thoughts ",
