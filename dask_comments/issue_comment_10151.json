Yeah, might be bad, but consider build-systems in a version control environment.\r\n\r\nDropping versioneer seems like the way to go:\r\n- no dev has picked up versioneer (see links below)\r\n- no way to ENV-overwrite versions (see https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer/issues/199 and https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer/pull/238\r\n- other packages also see problems maintaining versioneer https://github.com/NASA-PDS/devops/issues/12\r\n\r\n(note this problem is for dask-distributed, but it seems like you want to consolidate issues related to builds here).",
