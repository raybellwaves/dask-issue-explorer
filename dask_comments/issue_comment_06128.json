Looking at the PR that added that section of documentation (xref https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/1690), it appears using the convention of `<optimization-name>_<keyword-name>` was meant to apply to built in optimizations like `fuse` and `inline_functions` but not to user-defined optimizations. Though I agree that's not clear in the documentation. There's certainly room for documentation improvements here. ",
