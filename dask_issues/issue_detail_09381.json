    "body": "`da.store` is basically the main method for writing arrays out of dask; things like `to_zarr` use `da.store` internally, and downstream projects like xarray use it extensively. Currently, it produces low-level graphs. These graphs would be very simple to convert to Blockwise: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/8b95f983c232c1bd628e9cba0695d3ef229d290b/dask/array/core.py#L4430-L4433\r\n\r\nWe're just mapping a function over every block, which is the simplest case for Blockwise.\r\n\r\nThis would make graph generation (if not submission, everything gets materialized right now anyway) a lot faster for large array-writing operations, and allow blockwise fusion onto input tasks.\r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora @ian-r-rose",
