That is, one can already use client as a context manager, and if one could pass priority/resouces/etc. to Client isn't that enough?  Why does there need to be yet another context manager?\r\n\r\nI'll check out the docs you pointed to to see if I can understand.  It's not clear to me what is available now vs. in development.",
