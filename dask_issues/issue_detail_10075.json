Although there are certainly ways for users to optimize their code to avoid doing this. It may also be useful to expose a `DataFrame.merge` argument through which the user can make a \"promise\" to Dask that a particular collection is already shuffled by the necessary columns. This PR is intended as a POC for such an option.",
