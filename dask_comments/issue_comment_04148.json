This cuts down on the time to construct graphs and send graphs to the Scheduler dramatically. On the Scheduler the graph is then unfolded into a more fine grained graph and optimized for execution. For more dense or complex graphs this can improve overall execution time (and cutdown on latency between submitting work from the Client to getting it to run on the Workers).\r\n\r\nThat said, IDK to what extent this would be an issue for use cases needing `apply_blocks`.",
