        "body": "We removed a lot of special treatmenents in `check_thread_leak` function to track down leakages. One of the changes was that we now \"warm up\" the BaseTCPConnector Threadpool, see https://github.com/dask/distributed/blob/2fffe74dde40238a3387d12740ff9a54c16acb9f/distributed/utils_test.py#L1573-L1576 \r\nhttps://github.com/dask/distributed/blob/2fffe74dde40238a3387d12740ff9a54c16acb9f/distributed/comm/tcp.py#L411-L419\r\n\r\nsince otherwise the thread leakage check would detect false positives\r\n\r\nThat was part of https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/5771\r\n\r\nThis seems to trigger the exception when Tornado tries to initialize the `netutil.ExecutorResolver`. Not sure why this raises but this resolver has been deprecated in tornado 5+, see also https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/5771/files#r800928588",
