I think at least for pandas' default `orient` they look similar enough.\r\n\r\nPandas doesn't support arrays with 2 dimensions, i.e., all the values in the dict have to be 1D arrays. I'd like to also deal with 2D arrays as in the \"AC\" array in the example above, with the second dimension being automatically split into multiple columns (\"AC_1\", \"AC_2\", \"AC_3\").\r\n\r\n",
