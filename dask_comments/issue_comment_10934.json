        "body": "Thanks for opening the issue. First of all, this is all up for debate. Nothing here has been definitively decided.\r\n\r\nOur intention is currently to enable the query planning as soon as possible. We feel good about the current performance and stability. However, we won't be able to release it with full API coverage and are rather focusing on the most important APIs (e.g. currently `dask-expr` does not support something like DataFrame.meld or named groupby aggregations). Considering that users can always opt-out we believe that this is the approach that is beneficial to most users. At this point we already believe that dask-expr is better for most users than the legacy DataFrame API.\r\n\r\nThere are two missing features that possibly lock out a larger number of users than we'd feel comfortable with. These are\r\n\r\n- Annotations https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/10937 / https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr/issues/13 which are important for all users who are relying on worker resources, worker/host restrictions, etc.\r\n- Distributed Scheduler integration https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr/issues/14 which would hit users with very large graphs\r\n\r\n~Giving a commitment for a specific release is difficult but given the current release schedule I consider `2024.3.0` (release date 2024-03-01) possible but a little optimistic. I am confident that we can manage `2024.3.1` (release date 2024-03-15). If we were to cut both feature we could flip the switch right now already.~\r\n\r\nEdit: I got mixed up in my calendar. I suspect the most realistic release date will be `2024.3.0` which should happen on 2024-03-08. If we reduce scope and are fine without annotations/scheduler integrations we can go sooner.\r\n\r\n> What is the earliest date that \"dataframe.query-planning\": \"False\" will be disabled entirely?\r\n\r\nThere hasn't been any decision about this, yet. My current assumption is that we'll hold on to this for a while until we're certain that we won't cut out larger user groups.\r\nWhile it would be nice to be able to delete the old DataFrame code we're not in a rush considering that the old HLG backend is still in use for Arrays and Bags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease let us know if anything here sounds concerning or problematic. We're also interested if this all sounds too careful or too reckless :)",

        "body": "We're currently seeing a couple of weird recursive import errors when using dask-expr in our coiled benchmarks test suite, see https://github.com/coiled/benchmarks/pull/1419 This is something we definitely want to fix or at least have better understood before moving forward.\r\nThis test suite is also running xgboost and from what we can tell, it is running as expected. We encountered an error in `dask-ml` related to wrong imports but otherwise no other issues popped up, yet. \r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest to not block on any of the above issues, i.e. neithe on the annotations https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/10937 nor on the scheduler integration https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr/issues/14\r\n\r\nThis would mean that the next release would have `dask-expr` enabled by default. In preparation of this, I propose to change the default on `main` as soon as possible to give downstream projects a chance to test against this. If any medium sized blockers pop up we'd postpone the release until those are fixed. If anything major comes up, we could still revert the toggle if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis leaves the question about what to do with pandas 1.X support. I opened another issue for this https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/10962",
