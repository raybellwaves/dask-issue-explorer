This patch ignores that difference because it's pretty likely to not be that important.\r\n- [n/a] Tests added / passed\r\n  (test_query_with_meta was made slightly weaker on 32-bit architectures by not requiring the same dtype)\r\n- [?] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n\r\nI made the patch pushed it to my own branch on github and waited for the tests to run. There's (now) one test failure that looks unrelated to this change. I think that's equivalent to the pre-commit run --all-files\r\n\r\n(On my first try I typoed the name of int_info and there were two test failures, so I'm pretty sure the test is actually running.)\r\n",
