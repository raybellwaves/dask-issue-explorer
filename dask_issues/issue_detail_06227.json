    "body": "The `dask.datasets` module includes functions like `dask.dataset.timeseries` or `dask.datasets.make_people` for Dask dataframes or Dask bags respectively from random data.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have other demonstration datasets for people who want to run performance benchmarks, particularly around Dask array.  Dask array is interesting because there are a few chunk-wise backends like cupy and sparse which would be fun to play with as well.\r\n\r\nI was speaking with @eric-czech and @alimanfoo about genomics data, which is interesting both in that it has a small data type, and can be sparse and compressible.  They may have thoughts on how to effectively simulate large data sets.",
