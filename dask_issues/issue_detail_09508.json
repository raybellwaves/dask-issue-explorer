    "body": "When developing new functionality/algorithms it's very useful to release an initial implementation quickly in order to get early feedback from users. That helps address questions like: Does this actually solve user's problems? Does the API feel intuitive? and so on. After getting initial feedback, we then go back and improve the implementation -- fixing reported bugs, make things more robust to edge cases, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, today we're not differentiating between of these quick, initial implementations that are under development, and other stable, rock solid parts of the codebase. This means users can come across something that's still under development (e.g. our `p2p` shuffling algorithm), have a bad experience, and think to themselves \"Dask is fragile and doesn't work\".\r\n\r\nIt'd be useful if we could signal to users when they're using something that's still under development. One way to accomplish this would be to add a custom `ExperimentalFeature` warning that we emit accordingly. I'm curious what others think about this. \r\n\r\ncc @gjoseph92 @ian-r-rose @rjzamora @jsignell @crusaderky @fjetter in case any of you have thoughts on this topic",
