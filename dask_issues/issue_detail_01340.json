    "body": "when saving to multiple nodes in the same hdf file (which i feel is the best compromise between efficiency and clean output), there's a bottleneck created by all subsequent to_hdf tasks depending on the first.\nIt might be worth creating a fake \"to_hdf\" node that will not depend on any input for this case.\n\nthis assumes PR #1293 is in, which is not the case atm, but i wanted to make sure this is noted somewhere.\n\nFor example, with `mode='a' or 'r+'`, there's no need to link anything.\n",
