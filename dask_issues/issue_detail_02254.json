    "body": "It would be very helpful if operations like `ghost`, `trim`, and `map_overlap` would support asymmetric ghosting (a.k.a. haloing).\r\n\r\nTo provide context, many filters have the option to specify the origin of the footprint (where the result will be placed) be somewhere other than its center. In these instances, one needs a larger halo on edges where the origin of the footprint is closest too. However one can get away with a much smaller halo on edges where the origin of the footprint is further from.\r\n\r\nAs it stands currently, halos must be symmetric meaning that one ends up having a larger halo in all directions if the origin of the footprint deviates from the center. When in reality the size of the block plus halo should be invariant to the origin of the footprint. This results in some unneeded computational inefficiency in these cases. Given common cases take the origin to an extreme (all the way to one end of the footprint), these inefficiencies are not insignificant.\r\n\r\nTo fix cases like these, I would propose that we allow a `list` to be specified for each dimension in addition to the already standard `int`. We could treat the `int` as a special form of the `list` case where both values in the `list` are the same. One could specify a `list` only on dimensions in need of this asymmetry. This `list` syntax can easily be used in conjuction with the `tuple` or `dict` syntax as well for improved versatility. This would allow for more appropriate halos to be specified in these cases where the footprint origin is not in the center.",
