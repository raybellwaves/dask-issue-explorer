I believe this is OK and will work in many cases (I've already used it this way), but it won't in some others where dask-mpi would be appropriate. See the part of the doc I'm working on:\r\n\r\n>While dask-jobqueue can perfectly be used to submit batch processing, it is\r\nbetter suited to interactive processing, using tools like ipython or jupyter\r\nnotebooks. Batch processing with dask-jobqueue can be tricky in some cases\r\ndepending on how your cluster is configured and which resources and queues you\r\nhave access to: scheduler might hang on for a long time before having some\r\nconnected workers, and you could end up with less computing power than you\r\nexpected. Another good solution for batch processing on HPC system using dask\r\nis the `dask-mpi <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/setup/hpc.html#using-mpi>`_\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should clarify this between us and also in Dask docs?\r\n\r\ncc @jhamman ",
