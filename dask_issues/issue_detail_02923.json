    "body": "During writing a dask dataframe to an output format all files are created eagerly and run as soon as they can.   This can cause incomplete datasets to be written to the underlying filesystem in case something goes wrong and incomplete datasets being visible to other users of the filesystem whilst the write is in progress.\r\n\r\nHadoop Mapreduce (and other jvm big data tools) deal with this by means of an OutputCommitter.  This changes the write procedure to write to a temporary location and then attempt to do an atomic (or at least close) move of the written parts (on completion of all of them) to their final location.\r\n\r\nFor blobstore backends (like s3) an approach can be made to write the files but delay their final commit until all parts have been written successfully.  See https://github.com/rdblue/s3committer for a s3 implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
