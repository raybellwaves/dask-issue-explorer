        "body": "Ah, that's a shame.  Two options that I see:\r\n\r\n1.  We still support `set`, which seems like an easy win for now\r\n2.  We support all list cases that don't look like a numpy dtype?  Depending on the shape of the data feels a bit gross, but I'll bet that it works 99% of the time\r\n\r\n> What about something like meta=db.Bag(...)?\r\n\r\nThis seems too forced to me.  If we do that we should just have a `to_bag` method which seems more discoverable.  The beauty of supporting something like list or set as meta is that it comes about through normal use of the dataframe API.  Users don't really have to think about `meta=` keywords at all.",
