This is a reasonable choice as currently dataframe libraries don't implement this functionality, but they may in the future ( https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf/issues/1728 ) ( https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/26380 ). It could make sense to adjust this code to somehow check for `__array_function__` explicitly and skip `__array_wrap__` in those cases as opposed to special casing dataframes.",
