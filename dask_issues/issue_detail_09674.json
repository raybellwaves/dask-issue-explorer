    "body": "I have a time-series data in dask dataframe. I am reading from huge parquet file (around 8 GB) which has 12 row-groups which translated to 12 partitions in dask after read_parquet.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAfter reading data there was multiple entries for a single timestamp. I performed groupby-sum aggregation over it to get rid of multiple entries.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThis happened successfully but it changed number of partitions to 1 which is [expected](https://examples.dask.org/dataframes/02-groupby.html#Many-groups). Further, I have to run some downstream operations on it, such as handling null values, resampling, scaling and transforming it to sequences. \r\n\r\n1. I was following [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51772090/dask-groupby-turns-multiple-partitions-into-one) question and was wondering would I lose parallelism because number of partition is 1 now? Does dask repartition it implicitly by default while performing operations on data frame?\r\n\r\n2. I was checking [split_out](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.dataframe.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.aggregate.html) parameter to control number of partitions, but it gave me warning \r\n\r\n> Cannot guarantee sorted keys for `split_out>1`. Try using split_out=1,\r\n> or grouping with sort=False.\r\n\r\nbut I need data sorted on timestamps. How can I ensure that while having npartitions > 1.\r\n\r\n3. There are some downstream operations which can again run across partition and give result in single partition. Do I need to monitor partitions every time and [repartition](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.dataframe.DataFrame.repartition.html) it explicitly to exploit parallelism?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DshdD.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Otp70.png\r\n",
