    "body": "Thinking about this in the context of converting NumPy arrays (or NumPy-like arrays) to Dask Arrays while still nicely handling the Dask Array case.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice for [`asarray`]( http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.asarray ) to take an optional `chunks` argument (default `None`). This could be used to set a chunking for a NumPy array, but maybe leave a Dask Array untouched (or possibly rechunked). My thoughts are mixed on this at this stage. Happy to hear other thoughts.\r\n\r\ncc @jni",
