        "body": "Thanks for raising @Tishj \r\n\r\nIt looks like the problem here is in the creation of a `dask.array.Array` with a `Float32Dtype()` (and probably not in `dask.dataframe`). As far as I can tell, `dask.dataframe` works with these dtypes just fine, but `dask.array` gets tripped up at creation time (i.e. when `ddf.values` is used). Here is another reproducer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ns_f32 = pd.Series([None, 1, 4294967295], dtype=\"float32\")\r\ns_F32 = pd.Series([None, 1, 4294967295], dtype=\"Float32\")\r\n\r\ndd.from_pandas(s_f32, npartitions=2).compute()  # Works fine\r\ndd.from_pandas(s_F32, npartitions=2).compute()  # Works fine\r\n\r\nda.from_array(s_f32.values)  # Works fine\r\nda.from_array(s_F32.values)  # Fails with `TypeError: Cannot interpret 'Float32Dtype()' as a data type`\r\n```",
