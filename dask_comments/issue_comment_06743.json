I also structured this so that if for any reason the wrapper threw an exception, the reader would still be returned.\r\n\r\nI considered applying this to `read_parquet` but that obviously wouldn't make sense since that is not based on the pandas reader.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to make further changes as needed, so please me know if there are any questions or concerns.
