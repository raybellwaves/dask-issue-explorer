Though would mention that [Zarr]( https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarr ) also does something like this when writing to a [`DirectoryStore`]( http://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/storage.html#zarr.storage.DirectoryStore ). It supports a [`MutableMapping`]( https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes ) interface. If you know your data to be arrays, then it has a higher level interface for that use case as well.",
