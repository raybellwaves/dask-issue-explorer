    "body": "I often hear something like \"the Dask docs are great, but can be a bit overwhelming when first getting started\". One reason is that Dask has some terminology that new users may be unfamiliar with (e.g. \"chunks\", \"task graph\", \"graph optimization\", etc.)\r\n\r\nXarray has a nice documentation page where they define common terms that are used throughout their project (https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/user-guide/terminology.html). \r\n\r\nWould adding a similar terminology page to Dask's documentation be useful? We could define terms like \"chunks\", \"task graph\", ... in a central location and then link back to the terminology page when we use a term like \"task graph\" in other documentation pages. This might help new users get up to speed on Dask's vocabulary more quickly. ",
