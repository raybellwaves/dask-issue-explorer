I'll try to find time to re-generate the error and raise a separate issue as appropriate if I can get a MCVE.\r\n\r\n##### re the shuffling:\r\nI have observed that peak memory is much lower using `shuffle=disk` instead of `tasks`, but was surprised by the size of the performance difference. I wanted to verify that this is expected as if so I think it should be made clear in the updated documentation.\r\n",

Thinking more about it, the limit is probably bandwidth to the disk, irrespective of how many processes are attempting to write to it.\r\n\r\nThank you for following up.",
