    "body": "I noticed that the `dask` FFT wrapper internally uses `numpy`'s FFT.\r\nUnless this is done to avoid a `scipy` dependency, I'd suggest switching to `scipy.fft` (not `scipy.fftpack`, which is now legacy) instead. \r\nThe advantage of `scipy.fft` is that it is much faster than `numpy.fft` when transforming multi-D arrays (even if only one axis is transformed), because it uses vector instructions where available. In addition to standard FFTs it also provides DCTs, DSTs and Hartley transforms. Optional shared-memory parallelization is available, and there are dedicated functions for single-precision transforms.\r\n",
