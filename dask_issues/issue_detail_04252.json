    "body": "Currently `da.map_overlap` supports edge paddings of different kinds along different dimensions. This complicates things like [using `da.pad` within `da.map_overlap`]( https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/3641 ).\r\n\r\nAFAIK there are no use cases for different edge paddings on different dimensions. The closest thing that I know of is to pad some dimensions and not others (i.e. having different depths per dimension), which can still be cast in terms of having the same padding for all dimensions (just some are trivial). Given this, I'd like to propose deprecating [`boundary` arguments]( http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/array-overlap.html#dask.array.map_overlap ) that are anything other than simple values (e.g. padding mode or constant for all dimensions).",
