Whereas the original optimization was relying on low-level fusion, the new version is using `Blockwise.io_deps` to effectively \"fuse\" simple input tasks that have no other dependencies.\r\n\r\nNote that I also fixed some of the existing tests that were inadvertently testing `optimize_blockwise` rather than `fuse_roots`.\r\n",
