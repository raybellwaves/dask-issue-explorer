    "body": "[Documentation regarding the HDFS integration](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/remote-data-services.html#hadoop-file-system) appears to be using a now deprecated version of the [HDFS API for authentication](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems_deprecated.html#hadoop-file-system-hdfs): note the new API does not provide a `user` argument so I _guess_ the auth functionality may be different/more restrictive (possibly Kerberos only?) \r\n\r\nThe documentation is obviously requiring reworking to depict this (I've fixed the link to point at the deprecated interface) but thought it might need review depending on how this component is implemented within dask itself, to remove support for the old API or allow usage of both depending on the integration requirements. \r\n\r\nHappy to look into it after I've finished my documentation review :-)",
