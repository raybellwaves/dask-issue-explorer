    "body": "I have some parquet files which are created by Spark converting AVRO file to parquet file. And these parquet files contain different data types like decimal, int,string. But when I read this file using the dd.read_parquet with pyarrow engine, except int everything else is converted to object data types and which causes an issue in arithmetic calculations. And i tried with the float dtypes for the decimal columns (which is having, upto 10 decimal places) but that will loose precision.\r\none thing I noticed when I read the same file with pandas dataframe it worked perfectly means the decimal columns are consider as object but still can do the arithmetic operations, but when it comes to Dask dataframe, the same decimal object is consider as string and getting the error like TypeError(\"can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'\"). is this feature is not available in dask dataframe?\r\nDask version: '2.3.0'\r\nPandas version: '0.25.0'",
