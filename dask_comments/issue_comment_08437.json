        "body": "To me, this has actually been an accidental feature, rather than a bug \u2014 that is I can just `map_partitions` and be sure that I don't get a single index value split over multiple partitions.\r\n\r\nPossibly there should be an option to still force that behaviour, a function that merges partitions with overlapping index, or perhaps an option to `map_partition` that treats those partitions as a single partition.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that the need for this completely disappears if https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8361 gets implemented, but not all of my uses for `map_partitions` use groupby. I have for example used it to perform window operations within a single index. One could use something like `groupby().transform`, but that operated slower on Pandas level than custom vectorized versions with lag operations etc. Using `map_partitions` there at least lets Dask know that no communication is needed between partitions.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is: you might sometimes want to \"map over index\" without using a groupby aggregation. Currently, `map_partitions` provides that functionality thanks to this \"bug\".",
