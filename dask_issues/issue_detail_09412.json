    "body": "Currently, `da.from_delayed` is not an inverse function of `da.to_delayed`.\r\n\r\n`da.to_delayed` returns a NumPy array, with object dtype, where each element is a Delayed object referring to that chunk of the array.\r\n\r\nBut `da.from_delayed` only accepts a single Delayed object, representing a single chunk of the array. You'd have to map this over every Delayed object, then use `da.stack` to combine them all together. Not only is this inconvenient, it's also much less performant: the `stack` operation will add unnecessary complexity to the graph, plus will be quite slow to run for large numbers of chunks: https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/5913#issuecomment-587360588.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense for `from_delayed` to have a fastpath if the input is a NumPy array of `Delayed`s, which would add minimal (or, when possible, zero) complexity to the graph, and at most 1 extra HLG layer.\r\n\r\ncc @ian-r-rose @jsignell ",
