It looks this is the relevant section of the codebase\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/303f4433a5314b7202c8c77201eda8d0f38e5920/dask/dataframe/io/csv.py#L202-L204\r\n\r\nPyArrow strings would make sense here. @phofl what's the current status of Categorical + PyArrow on the `pandas` side? Maybe those are still PyArrow dicts? \r\n",
