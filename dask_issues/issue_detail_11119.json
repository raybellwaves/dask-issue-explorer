    "body": "<!-- Please do a quick search of existing issues to make sure that this has not been asked before. -->\r\nI am wondering if `dask` or `pandas` has native or built-in support for aggregate function that run against vector data. Namley, text/image embeddings are stored in the column of `csv/parquet` file. And I'd like to run various aggregate functions such as `mean`, `max` and so on. All these operations are element-wise, namely, it returns the mean of all the values in same index and return an array with same lenght. What's more, I'd like to run `K-Nearest-Neighbor` search as well.\r\n\r\nIf not natively supported, how to achieve these operations with performance efficient?\r\n\r\nexample code:\r\n```\r\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n# Sample DataFrame with arrays in one of the columns\r\ndata = {\r\n    'category': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B'],\r\n    'values': [np.array([1, 2, 3]), np.array([4, 5, 6]), np.array([7, 8, 9]), np.array([10, 11, 12])],\r\n    'scalar': [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n}\r\npdf = pd.DataFrame(data)\r\n\r\n# Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a Dask DataFrame\r\nddf = dd.from_pandas(pdf, npartitions=2)\r\n\r\nresult = ddf.groupby('category')['values'].mean().compute()\r\n\r\nprint(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected output\r\n```\r\ncategory\r\nA     [2.5, 3.5, 4.5]\r\nB    [8.5, 9.5, 10.5]\r\nName: values, dtype: object\r\n```",
