Is this typically for multidimensional FFTs, batched 1D FFTs or for a single large 1D FFT?\r\n\r\nI don't have experience with performing a single 1D FFT in a distributed fashion, but the references @martindurant provided sound like they may be related to the approach described in the [multi-GPU 1D cuFFT docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufft/index.html#oned-mgpu-data-organization). I would have to think about it, but it seems plausible that Dask could do something similar, possibly with some restrictions on the chunk sizes.\r\n\r\n@leofang added multi-GPU 1D FFTs to CuPy last year. It seems based on [this comment](https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/2644#issuecomment-558835428) that it is useful mainly when the data is too big to fit in memory. ",

        "body": "Thanks Greg! Yeah I think this can come up with 1-D particularly if people are separating dimensions for an N-D case. This comes up in a few communities (biological imaging, medical imaging, satellite imaging, and larger scale modeling). The use cases are either wanting the result from the FFT itself or reusing it in something else like convolutions (or other operations reducible to a series of convolutions).",

        "body": "@grlee77 I didn't even remember I had that repo, and I can't say anything about whether the code in there works.  In particular, I've never been very good at using dask, so I kind of think I just gave up on that repo.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have https://github.com/moble/out_of_core_fft, which was mostly written after that other repo.  I can't guarantee its current state (e.g., CI fails because of pytest updates), but I will say that it has worked very well for me and others in the past, even for FFTs of arrays of sizes upwards of 32GB (which was ~4 times as big as my total memory at the time).\r\n\r\nI should note that, because of the nature of this approach, there is potential for this to be *extremely* slow if memory-access patterns get weird.  I guess a dask chunk has similar issues to HDF5 chunks \u2014 which is what I was dealing with in that second repo.  But there are almost certainly use cases I didn't consider, so it would probably pay to put some thought into generalizing my approach.\r\n\r\nBut if some dask expert could push this through, I think it would be a really cool addition!",

        "body": "Thanks @grlee77 for the pointers to FluidFFT and the out-of-core implementation. My impression for mpi4py-fft aligns with your assessment. It seems straightforward to me to support cuFFT in mpi4py-fft because of the application of \"standard FFT\" (which includes numpy.fft, scipy.fft, pyfftw, etc), so I need to read more to understand if FluidFFT addresses other things not considered by mpi4py-fft. (I was interested in this cuFFT extension but got distracted by other things...)",
