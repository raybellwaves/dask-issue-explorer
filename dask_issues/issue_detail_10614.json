    "body": "For a particular operation I would like to perform using Dask I am interested in a left join on a not-index column. However, after the merge operation, the index column is removed from the dataframe. Why is the merge operation implemented such that the index is removed after merging? As far as I could test, the index column is only maintained when the join operation is performed on the index itself. I think that more use-cases should exist where one would want to maintain the index after adding information using a left-join operation. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndata_left = dd.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame({'index': [\"id_A\", \"id_B1\", \"id_C\"], 'key': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'value1': ['aa','bb','cc']}), npartitions=1)\r\ndata_left = data_left.set_index('index', sort=True)\r\n\r\ndata_right = dd.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame({'key': [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"], 'value2': ['aa','bb','cc']}), npartitions=1)\r\n\r\nmerged_df = data_left.merge(data_right, how='left', left_on='key', right_on='key')\r\n\r\nprint(merged_df.compute())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives the output (without the index column):\r\n```\r\n   key value1 value2\r\n0   A     aa     aa\r\n1   B     bb     bb\r\n2   C     cc     cc\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2023.10.0\r\n- Python version: Python 3.11.2\r\n- Operating System: Windows 10 Enterprise\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): pip\r\n",
