(as `dask` depends on `pandas`)\r\n\r\nBesides that, all 576 tests pass :)\r\nThis was a bit harder than the other issue I solved (since `pandas` has weird behavior with respect to what Index it returns -- a `MultiIndex` or `RangeIndex`). Regardless, it's ready to merge from my side.\r\n\r\nI have also fixed the initial `metadata` issue and now I use `assert_eq` (the recommended and ideal way) for the tests rather than comparing `dicts` of outputs using only `assert`.",
