    "body": "The _local.get_async_ function only uses the submit function even when the actual scheduler used is a _concurrent.futures.Executor_ and _chunksize > 1_ or a call to the _map_ method would be more efficient. Using the _map_ method would also allow another slightly different approach to be implemented where chunking is delegated to the executor. That is, all tasks could be sent simultaneously using _map_ and the optimization of task distribution would be delegated to the provided executor.\r\n",
