    "body": "- [ ] Closes https://github.com/dask/community/issues/109\r\n- [ ] Tests added / passed\r\n- [ ] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n\r\nThis is a Dask implementation of the [Python Array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/), discussed in https://github.com/dask/community/issues/109.\r\n\r\nIt is provided in the `dask.array_api` namespace, so it is independent of the existing `dask.array` implementation.\r\n\r\nThere are a few parts of the API that are not implemented since they don't exist in Dask (such as [sorting functions](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/sorting_functions.html), and [in-place operations](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification/array_object.html#in-place-operators)), and these are excluded when running the test suite. Apart from these tests there are [two failures](https://github.com/tomwhite/dask/runs/5306535598?check_suite_focus=true): one (`test_array_object.py::test_getitem_masking`) looks like it is a shape problem in the test suite, the other should be fixed by #8676. (Note that more edge-case failures will be found when we get Hypothesis to try more examples.)\r\n\r\nI've included a GitHub action to run the [array API test suite](https://github.com/data-apis/array-api-tests), but I've configured it to be [triggered manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) for the time being since not all tests are passing yet.",
