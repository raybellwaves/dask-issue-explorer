Is that useful? There is a weird recursive nature here where you end up with a dask array with a DataArray underneath with a dask array underneath.\r\n\r\nThinking about the warning, why is it not an error? When would someone get that warning and it **not** produce an issue? Is it a warning because things going wrong is a special case or are things going right a special case? If things going wrong is the special case then I can see a warning (versus an error) being OK. If things going wrong is the common case then I (as not a dask dev) feel this should be an error.",
