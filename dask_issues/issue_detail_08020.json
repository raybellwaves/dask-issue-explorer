    "body": "I was putting together a demo using our `timeseries` utility and noticed generating random integers can take a significant amount of time -- especially when generating a DataFrame with many columns. After digging in a bit deeper, this is because we're generating integers from a Poisson distribution\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/da2458250d4fcd8f1a99458778de536a667224a2/dask/dataframe/io/demo.py#L16-L17\r\n\r\nwhich can be an order of magnitude slower than from, for example, a uniform distribution:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: import numpy as np\r\n\r\nIn [2]: rstate = np.random.RandomState(2)\r\n\r\nIn [3]: %timeit rstate.poisson(1_000, size=86_400)   # 86_400 is the default partition size for `timeseries`\r\n5.39 ms \u00b1 41.2 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [4]: %timeit rstate.randint(low=0, high=1e9, size=86_400)\r\n395 \u00b5s \u00b1 1.98 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\r\n\r\nIn [5]: 5.39e3 / 395\r\nOut[5]: 13.645569620253164\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes we switch to using a uniform distribution for generating random integers. \r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora who has recently worked with our `timeseries` utility",
