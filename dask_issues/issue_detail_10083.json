We might consider using this utility in our tokenization code, if the functionality suites our needs and doesn't introduce serious performance regressions, since we currently rely on some private `pandas` methods. I don't think this is high priority, just wanted to document this idea. \r\n\r\ncc @phofl for visibility",
