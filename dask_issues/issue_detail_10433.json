For example\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef add_lengths(bag: dask.bag.Bag[list[dict[str, Any]]]) -> dask.bag.Bag[list[dict[str, Any]]]:\r\n    return bag.map(add_length)\r\n\r\ndef add_length(item: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:\r\n    item[\"length\"] = len(item[\"document\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would be happy to write the PR for this, but I wanted to make sure that y'all would be interested in that, and to see if there are any foreseeable pitfalls here.",
