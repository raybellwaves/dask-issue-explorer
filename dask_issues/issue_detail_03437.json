    "body": "Currently the `map_blocks`/`map_overlap` interfaces provide one main way to pass arguments and keyword arguments that is a variadic `**kwargs` argument. However if one has keyword arguments that overlap with those that `map_blocks`/`map_overlap` take, then one is either not able to pass them or has to write a shim function to map the arguments to something that won't conflict. With variadic arguments, one can pass them along to `map_blocks` (not to `map_overlap`), but they may or may not work. In the case of `map_overlap`, variadic arguments are simply unsupported.\r\n\r\nThis could be fixed by adding two arguments to `map_blocks`/`map_overlap`. Namely `func_args` and `func_kwargs`. These would be regular arguments taking a sequence and a mapping respectively. Also these would not be treated as non-Dask collection arguments. In the implementation detail, these would be unpacked in the function call. This would avoid confusion caused by trying to have these arguments live alongside arguments to `map_blocks`/`map_overlap`. Longer term, the old strategy of passing arguments could be deprecated and dropped by 1.0.\r\n\r\nxref: https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/3263\r\nxref: https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/3081",
