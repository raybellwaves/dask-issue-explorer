    "body": "Opening this issue to discuss supporting stencil operations in Dask. Am interested to see a nice wrapper function or functions that do a reasonably good job at wrapping up common case stencil function APIs. Also should work for users interested in adding their own custom stencil operations. Just a few cases and relevant discussions are listed below. As suggested elsewhere by @mrocklin, these might benefit from using `map_overlap` for the implementation.\r\n\r\nIt may make more sense to hash this out after we have tried to handle a few cases. Then again a good wrapper could really open the door for a lot of cool operations in Dask or with Dask much faster.\r\n\r\ncc @rabernat @mrocklin\r\n\r\nxref: https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2241\r\nxref: https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2147\r\nxref: https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2132#issuecomment-290107519",
