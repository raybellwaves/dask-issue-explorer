    "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nAfter submitting my PR recently, I've noticed that each test job took about 6 minutes to set up the conda environment. I've noticed that the workflow has no caching mechanism, even though a simple example solution can be found in the official [docs](https://github.com/conda-incubator/setup-miniconda#caching-environments) of the `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda` action.\r\n\r\nWhat is more, a similar issue has been raised in the [dask distributed](https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/6853) repo. I have some experience with GitHub Actions and would be happy to submit a similar PR.",
