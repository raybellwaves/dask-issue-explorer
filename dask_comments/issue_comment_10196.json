That said, I find `flake8` to be slower than I would like sometimes. I'm also mildly in favor assuming the migration wouldn't be too involved. How was the switch to `ruff` over in `pandas`? Was it mostly just swapping out a few configuration lines, or was it much more extensive than that? ",

The added performance is not really noticeable in that repo right now though as files are only a few hundred lines.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to switch to it in https://github.com/dask/dask-kubernetes/pull/815 and the migration seemed quite easy. @droctothorpe can comment more on that though. The decision to use `ruff` there came from the question \"should we add `isort`?\" and given my experience in `kr8s` I suggested replacing `flake8` with `ruff` and enabling the `isort` ruleset too.",
