Stealing the code snippet below from @jcrist's [comment]( https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/2377#issuecomment-305232945 ). This is needed for use cases where having reproducible hashes are necessary (e.g. caching, versioning, etc.).\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndask.set_options(tokenize_hash='mmh3')  # use mmh3, error if not available\r\ndask.set_options(tokenize_hash=None)   # Use best available hash, default behavior\r\n```",
