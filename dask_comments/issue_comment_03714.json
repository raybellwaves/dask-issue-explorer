Something is going awry in https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/d8a4f3be9a6ec685261ed043a45ecc019055ec0d/dask/dataframe/core.py#L4432.\r\n\r\nI think this is perhaps hard to support. Dask's metadata requires that the divisions be the minimum value in each partition and the max value of the last partition. When a user passes an anchored offset like `W-THU`, we're stuck because the first / last value may not be on that anchor.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I think this example should raise on the `.repartition(freq='W-THU')` when we can't actually create divisions with that frequency (i.e. the current dataset doesn't end and begin on a Thursday. Does that make sense?",
