We installed pyarrow `14.0.2`.\r\n\r\nThe important observation is that **TypeError error disappears** if I take only part of the dataset as follows:\r\n```python\r\nddf.loc[:100000]\r\n``` \r\nHowever, disabling the `dask-expr` still leads to an error:\r\n```\r\nValueError: Length of values (0) does not match length of index (100001)\r\n```\r\n(I've added a note to the description)",
