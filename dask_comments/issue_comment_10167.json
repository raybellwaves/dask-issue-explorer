GitHub releases (or maybe GitHub packages if it supports it)\r\n\r\nProbably 1 or 2 is easiest since we already make use of those. Maybe 1 could dovetail into existing release processes. 2 would benefit from existing nightly build infra. There may be some benefits to 3 (if viable) as it could integrate well with GHA",
