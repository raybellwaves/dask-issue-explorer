    "body": "It would be nice to have a way to use the [bottleneck](https://pypi.org/project/Bottleneck/) package's nan-aware functions such as ``nanmedian`` and so on when calling ``da.nanmedian`` and other similar dask functions. The bottleneck functions are in general faster and use up much less memory than their Numpy counterparts.\r\n\r\nThis could be done either by adding a kwarg to the dask functions, or maybe having a way to register in the dask configuration that bottleneck alternatives are acceptable, and then just using them behind the hood in ``da.nanmedian`` if that configuration value is set? Or if bottleneck is installed, they could even be used by default?",
