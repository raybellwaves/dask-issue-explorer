        "body": "Thanks for the explanation @fjetter!\r\n\r\nI don't think it is that surprising that `s.str.split('/')` returns a Series of lists -- the `.str` accessor doesn't necessarily imply the _return_ type. However it is a bit counterintuitive that `.str.join` uses the `.str` accessor on a Series that isn't of strings -- I hadn't thought about that before. That said, it is clearly documented that way: \r\n\r\n> Join lists contained as elements in the Series/Index with passed delimiter.\r\n\r\n~ https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.join.html",
