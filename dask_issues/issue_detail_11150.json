    "body": "Noticed that dask-expr added support for left semi joins on CPU, but the test for it here is still xfailing because pandas doesn't natively support this join type.\r\n\r\nModified this test to compute the pandas leftsemi join similarly to how it's done in dask-expr's test suite ([link](https://github.com/dask/dask-expr/blob/97de2ab16d0999a74d6e108504dde503caee2ab9/dask_expr/tests/test_merge.py#L981)), so that we can at least verify that the graph computes successfully in this case.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nFollowing up on discussion in https://github.com/dask/dask-expr/pull/1073#discussion_r1619366034, also pushing some changes here to unblock left anti joins on CPU with query planning.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx\r\n- [ ] Tests added / passed\r\n- [ ] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
