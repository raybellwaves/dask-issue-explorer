Exiting...\r\nWarning: If you think that not enough issues were processed you could try to increase the quantity related to the operations-per-run (\u200bhttps://github.com/actions/stale#operations-per-run\u200b) option which is currently set to 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nabout hitting the default limit on GitHub API calls (as the warning says, the `actions/stale` action defaults to a limit of 30 API calls, but is configurable via the `operations-per-run` option). My guess is we should increase `operations-per-run` for our stale GHA, but I've not yet looked into what API rate limits GitHub itself imposes. We'll want to strike a balance where the stale action is able to use more API calls while not bringing down other services too. \r\n\r\ncc @GenevieveBuckley @jsignell ",
