        "body": "I took a look at dask-image. It seems to use `pims` library's `open` function. I avoided this initially since it looked like it only accepted single files or glob patterns based on the quick start, but looking deeper it should take a list of filenames.\r\n\r\nI wanted to use this functionality for a simple side project (local python meetup kaggle competition), but I ended up using some parts of scikit-image that aren't dask friendly from what I can tell and the computations I'm doing are per-frame so having one giant dask array doesn't necessarily benefit me.\r\n\r\nThat said, I brought this up and bugged you so I'll try to add the functionality. @jcrist, making the IO functions consistent would be nice. I'm wondering if there is a reason that this `imread` function was written to use mtime though. I'm a little worried to break this. Regardless, maybe the dask-core version of this should stay as-is and I should look at dask-image more.",
