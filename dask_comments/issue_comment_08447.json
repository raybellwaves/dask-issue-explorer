In the interim, I propose that by default, we still do low-level fusion when any of the layers in the graph are materialized.\r\n\r\nMy motivation to finally refocus my efforts on HLG cleanup is certainly reaching a tipping point! Sorry for being somewhat MIA in these topics lately.\r\n\r\nI agree that we probably want the middle ground you are suggesting. As I type this, I see that you submitted a PR - So, perhaps we can discuss the specific details there :)",
