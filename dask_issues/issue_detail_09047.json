    "body": "This is a discussion originating from the discourse: https://dask.discourse.group/t/provide-a-custom-task-name-for-dataframe-tasks/669.\r\n\r\nBasically, a lot of the reporting tools including the dashboard and error messages use the task keys/names. When these are generated by high level `DataFrame` methods, we get uninformative keys like `apply-82c6e19adcd3da8d269920ee38886065`. The issue with these is that it's hard to tell what part of your code is actually running, since you probably `apply()` several times in your code.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the dashboard, you might want to look at what tasks your worker is running, but this tells you basically nothing:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019367/167081436-51d2e8b5-d59f-4e31-9b4f-f5c267db57e3.png)\r\n\r\nTherefore I would like to request a mechanism for adding a task name prefix or suffix to auto-generated tasks. The API doesn't particularly matter, but I would envisage something like this:\r\n```python\r\nfrom dask.dataframe import read_parquet, task_prefix\r\n\r\ndf = read_parquet\r\nwith task_prefix(\"calc-foo\")\r\n    df.assign(foo = df.apply(...))\r\n\r\nwith task_prefix(\"aggregate-bar\")\r\n    df.groupby(\"bar\").agg(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then we get informative keys like:\r\n```\r\ncalc-foo-assign-82c6e19adcd3da8d269920ee38886065\r\ncalc-foo-apply-82c6e19adcd3da8d269920ee38886065\r\naggregate-bar-groupby-82c6e19adcd3da8d269920ee38886065\r\naggregate-bar-agg-82c6e19adcd3da8d269920ee38886065\r\n```",
