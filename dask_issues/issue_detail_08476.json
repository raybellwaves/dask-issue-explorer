Currently, it is much too easy to accidentally materialize the layer (for example, the HTML repr triggers a call to `__len__`). This PR addresses that.\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/7788 and closes https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/7791\r\n- [x] Tests ~~added~~ / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
