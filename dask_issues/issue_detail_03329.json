    "body": "There is a lot of functionality built into Dask for optimizing Dask Collections and handling this differently per Dask Collection type. Also it is pretty easy to override the optimization strategy globally (even for small blocks of code). However it's not clear to me (though it may exist), how one goes about specializing the optimization of particular instances. Some forms of optimization may be poor for a type overall. However if one knows a particular instance will benefit from a particular optimization in the future, it would be nice to have a way to hook that into the instance so it can be triggered when optimizations occur.",
