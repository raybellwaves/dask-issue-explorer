I completely misunderstood some details of `map_blocks`, and hadn't realized that the dropped dimensions were literally being ignored (not projected into the 0th dimension).  My mistake.  It looks like `map_blocks` may be a \"no go\" in cases where the number of chunks in the dropped dimension is >1.\r\n\r\nThings seem to \"work\" with [manual graph construction](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/4855#issuecomment-497062002), but I don't see much of a perf advantage.\r\n",
