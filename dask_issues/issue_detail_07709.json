I think it would be useful to update it to include a runnable example and some information about the `Layer` class. \r\n\r\nOnce that page is updated, it will probably make sense to update https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/phases-of-computation.html and https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/graphs.html to make it clearer how HLGs fit in.\r\n\r\nI am happy to take on this work, but just wanted to put this here in case I am missing something. \r\n\r\nSome resources that I am planning to draw on:\r\n[Layer Issue](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/6438)\r\n[Blog post about scheduling](https://blog.dask.org/2020/07/21/faster-scheduling)\r\n[Scheduling workshop from summit](https://zoom.us/rec/share/vO7Xx5HAupQHDEjTgmspp6VZoCY_zabi1nouOHCwl4mBSg2hVQpIFqTTpVQUNZA4.8cE5K7SjaMIUNINW?startTime=1621620212000)\r\n\r\nPinging the people who I have seen working on HLG related things: @rjzamora @GenevieveBuckley @gjoseph92 @ian-r-rose @jrbourbeau ",
