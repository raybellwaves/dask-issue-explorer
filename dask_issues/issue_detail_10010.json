Instead I think `head()` and `tail()` should return a Dask DataFrame that users can then call `compute()` on like most other methods. \r\n\r\nSince both these methods already have a `compute=` keyword that is `True` by default, I'll suggest we:\r\n\r\n1. Deprecate the current `compute=True` default value and inform users that in the future `compute=` will default to `False`\r\n2. After a while, change the default to `compute=False`  ",
