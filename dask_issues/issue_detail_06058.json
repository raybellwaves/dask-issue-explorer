Because `xskillscore` is an extension of `xarray` it works with `dask`. I was looking to repeat this workflow using a `dask.dataframe`. In the end I went with the `dask.array` approach (https://github.com/raybellwaves/xskillscore-tutorial/blob/master/03_Big_Data.ipynb).\r\n\r\n@mrocklin @TomAugspurger apologies for the tagging. you may know if there are `xarray` devs here who may be interested.",
