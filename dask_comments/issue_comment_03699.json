        "body": "Yeah... I get that. Filter and do something.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm struggling with is how to do stuff with that uncertainty. The recursion step involves creating another matrix to apply QR to. So when chunk sizes are known, the computational graph is completely defined. On the other hand... With uncertainty, we don't know what we end up with.\r\n\r\nCertainly, we could throw together a hack based on the number of chunks, such as doing one level of recursion an creating some number of chunks to pass into a non-recursing call of `tsqr`. Based on \"practical expectations\", such as your \"non-recursing\" case where the blocks had a high aspect ratio (to be expected), it's unlikely that more that one recursive call would be necessary.",
