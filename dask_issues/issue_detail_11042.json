    "body": "Just opening this issue to track missing bits from the array API missing in scikit-learn.\r\n\r\nThere's only one use of ``det``/``slogdet`` in scikit-learn, but I figured others might want to be able to do determinants in dask.\r\n\r\nI think this can be implemented by doing a PLU decomp and then getting the determinant of the ``P`` matrix, and the product of diagonals of ``L`` and ``U``.\r\n\r\nCalculating the determinant of ``P`` (or more precisely its sign) doesn't seem to be easy, though.\r\n(Maybe pivots, like ``scipy.linalg.lu_factor`` provides are needed?)",
