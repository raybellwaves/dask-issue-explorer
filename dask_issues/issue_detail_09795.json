    "body": "Ref: https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-awkward/issues/138\r\n\r\nThe referenced issue provides a way to make a dask HLG having 746 layers. This size, and much bigger, look like they might be common with dask-awkward and high-energy physics workloads - but are far from typical in normal array and dataframe usage.\r\n\r\nWhen wishing to compute the result, optimizaion happens, including `dask.blockwise.optimize_blockwise` to merge layers where possible. This takes 2.1s for this simple example, by far dominating the compute time. Looking at the profile, all the time is in `rewrite_blockwise`, which calls `subs()` 7.5M times. Given that this is working on layers, not tasks, I am surprised. The code of `rewrite_blockwise` appears to be N**2, and I cannot understand yet how it works. (in the example in the linked issue, there is only one partition, so everything goes much much faster by immediately falling back to a low-level graph)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n- Dask version: main\r\n",
