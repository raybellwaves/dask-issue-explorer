    "body": "I ran into a performance issue with related to reshaped dask arrays while using xarray (https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/2241). I opened an issue there, but I think this is actually more of a dask issue. Here is some example code which demonstrates the slow down\r\n```python\r\n>>> a = da.random.random((64, 64, 64), (8,8,-1))\r\n>>> b = a.reshape((64**2, 64))\r\n>>> %timeit b[0].compute()\r\n3.2 ms \u00b1 13 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\r\n>>> %timeit a[0,0].compute()\r\n628 \u00b5s \u00b1 13.8 \u00b5s per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)\r\n```\r\n`b[0]` and `a[0,0]` should in principle refer to the same data, but the reshaped values take almost 4 times as long to compute. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nThis is on dask 0.17.1",
