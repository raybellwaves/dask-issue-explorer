        "body": "I am working with 450 million rows and have to set a new index for a group-by operation on that dataset. The original data is 23GiB when saved as parquet files and doing the `.set_index()` operation was eating all 390GiB of available RAM space on the local multi-cpu cluster I am using. After changing to this PR and running with `shuffle=\"service\"` the shuffle on the 450 million rows (41 million unique values in new index) completed in 30 minutes on 30 process workers while never using more than 50 GiB of RAM. Therefore my review for this PR is very positive. I just saw this and applied it and it worked great for me.",
