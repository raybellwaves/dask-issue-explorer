The errors I am running into are:\r\n\r\n* `da.from_array` - `chunks` is inferred as a `str`\r\n* `array.rechunk` - `chunks` is inferred as a `str`\r\n* `dd.from_delayed` returns `DataFrame | Series` and will always require a cast. Not sure how to fix that other than adding helpers.\r\n* `map_blocks` seems to not behave properly as a method in the eyes of `pyright`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nda.from_zarr(core.core_img).map_blocks(\r\n    segment_tissue,\r\n    dtype=np.uint8,\r\n    drop_axis=0,\r\n    downsample_factor=tissue_masks_params.downsample_factor,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nError:\r\n```\r\nArgument missing for parameter \"func\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you add explicit `func=segment_tissue`, then get an error about `self`:\r\n```\r\nArgument missing for parameter \"self\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps something wacky with `@wraps`:\r\n```py\r\n    @wraps(map_blocks)\r\n    def map_blocks(self, func, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        return map_blocks(func, self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`map_blocks` is of the following type. Looks like it is no longer recognized as a method or something.\r\n```py\r\nmap_blocks: _Wrapped[(func: Unknown, *args: Unknown, name: Unknown | None = None, token: Unknown | None = None, dtype: Unknown | None = None, chunks: Unknown | None = None, drop_axis: Unknown | None = None, new_axis: Unknown | None = None, enforce_ndim: bool = False, meta: Unknown | None = None, **kwargs: Unknown), Unknown, (self: Array, func: Unknown, *args: Unknown, **kwargs: Unknown), Unknown] | Any\r\n```",
