    "body": "The `imread` function currently performs a glob on the filename given to it as it expects a glob pattern to find local files. I have a case where I have a series of URLs, something that skimage imread can handle, and would like to load them in to one large dask array. I can see by reading the code that this is outside the expected use case of the function, but I think it could be updated to handle it. I'm wondering what be the best way to accomplish this if it fits in with what the original authors expected. Here's the main problem line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/d0daa5bc7e86677b38794d4f9294fcc386f7b067/dask/array/image.py#L48\r\n\r\nI'd like to make this take an iterable in which case we expect it not to be a glob pattern and don't assume that the image is on the local system at all.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif isinstance(filename, str):\r\n    # assume glob\r\nelse:\r\n    # assume iterable of URIs that exist\r\n# continue on as normal\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts? Problems?",
