In some preliminary tests I noticed a performance regression with the new matmul with sparse matrix inputs. We might want to either:\r\n * add some performance warning to dask matmul about optimal sparse chunking for matmul (or suggest to use `dot`)\r\n * tune it a for sparse inputs\r\n \r\nAnyhow will update with some more numbers.",
