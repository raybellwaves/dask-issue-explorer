        "body": "This is something I wrote up and showed @eriknw last week. It's very cheap to compute, but has fail cases. The idea here is that we use the convention of having each key in the graph be a tuple where the first element is a prefix followed by a hash. For dask collections this allows us to group keys from the same operation into a single box, unioning all inputs and outputs. However, this will fail for graphs that don't follow this convention, or graphs that were created with `dask.delayed`, as the tokens for `dask.delayed` graphs are all different.\r\n\r\nThe code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/jcrist/dc5b7cedfddff123f2177e5238e566e5).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: from vis import simple_vis\r\n\r\nIn [2]: import numpy as np\r\n\r\nIn [3]: import dask.array as da\r\n\r\nIn [4]: x = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))\r\n\r\nIn [5]: dx = da.from_array(x, chunks=(5, 5))\r\n\r\nIn [6]: res = dx.dot(dx.T).sum(axis=1).mean() + dx.mean(axis=0) * 4\r\n\r\nIn [7]: simple_vis(res)\r\nOut[7]: <IPython.core.display.Image object>\r\n\r\nIn [8]: res.visualize()\r\nOut[8]: <IPython.core.display.Image object>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full graph looks like:\r\n\r\n![mydask](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2783717/23974292/83cb90da-09a8-11e7-83e6-05e819796b71.png)\r\n\r\nWhile the simplified looks like:\r\n\r\n![simple](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2783717/23974296/86324dd2-09a8-11e7-86a5-caf601a85307.png)\r\n\r\nOne idea for how to use these would be to reuse the graphviz-to-bokeh code I wrote up 2 years ago to convert these graphs into bokeh plots. We could color the nodes the same as their progressbars, which would allow users to see the progress for each task, as well as where in the general pipeline each task is.\r\n",
