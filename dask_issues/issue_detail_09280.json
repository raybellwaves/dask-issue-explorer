It doesn't appear to do a good job on search term proximity or non-exact matches and maybe indexes too much on the API sections.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I search distributed docs for \"worker plugin\"\r\n\r\nhttps://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/search.html?q=worker+plugin\r\n\r\nit's quite challenging to see the result that I actually want.\r\n\r\nAnyone know anything about improving / changing the search engine used for this functionality?",
