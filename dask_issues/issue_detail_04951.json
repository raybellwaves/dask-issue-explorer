We have a few ways of handling such situations, including maintaining the current behavior, as noted by @mrocklin in https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/4914#issuecomment-502111112.\r\n\r\nOption 2 seems to be a good compromise between usability and developer support, allowing developers to more quickly identify issues that cause Dask to default to NumPy.\r\n\r\nSuch a warning should then be added to several parts of Dask, as for example `blockwise` and `meta_from_array` functions. Warnings suppressed by #5103 should be reenabled.",
