Specifically, `id(dsk)` is incorrect as the layer name here. The layer name must match the `.name` of the resulting collection that gets created by `__dask_postpersist__()` in `dask.optimize`, otherwise `__dask_layers__()` on the optimized collection will be wrong. Since `optimize` doesn't know about collections and isn't passed a layer name, the only reasonable thing to do here is to error when given a low-level graph.\r\nThis is safe to do for Arrays and DataFrames, since their constructors convert any low-level graphs to HLGs.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't really fix anything\u2014the code path removed should be unused\u2014but it eliminates a confusing pattern that has already wandered its way into other places https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/8316#discussion_r740570242.\r\n\r\ncc @ian-r-rose @madsbk \r\n\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`",
