Right now the proposal is just search locally -- do you think we'd want some mechanism for the user to ask where the configuration is being loaded from ?  For example, conda can do this in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(base) bzaitlen@dgx15:~$ conda config --show-sources\r\n==> /home/nfs/bzaitlen/.condarc <==\r\nchannels:\r\n  - conda-forge\r\n  - defaults\r\nreport_errors: False\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also explored providing this feedback in dask-cuda with https://github.com/rapidsai/dask-cuda/pull/1006 (though the name is not great and may also change) and asked about it here: https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/7106\r\n\r\nMy guess is this shouldn't be too hard to implement but we should just check with others like @jacobtomlinson / @jrbourbeau to make sure this isn't too \"magical\" ",

The change proposed here would resolve that user pain. \r\n- Easier to remember for Dask devs who want to experiment locally (this is @gjoseph92 wants) \r\n- This change is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nAlso cc @djhoese for visibility ",

        "body": "I'm also +0.5. From what I've seen of recent dask and xarray work, people are trying to get import time down. This is another iteration over something on disk that adds to import time. And as someone who has projects that allow configuration files/directories in the PWD, it becomes yet another thing you always have to ask users on support tickets (ex. \"Any chance you have a file named `dask.yaml` in your working directory?\").\r\n\r\nI agree that it would be nice for projects and developers to quickly customize their configuration and for a single use case scenario that maybe makes sense, but I'm not so sure for project-based use cases. Maybe I'm missing something. What kind of dask configuration options are people setting on a per-project basis? Is this like an ML project that knows that the settings for fusing or other optimizations should be set to X because they produce the best performance for their workflow? Or is this an infrastructure as code type of situation where a user just wants to specify the dask configuration for this deployment?\r\n\r\nLastly, how often is a user's custom configuration limited to a single config file? Dask configs don't support the idea of \"profiles\" right? If I'm a developer switching between two or more configuration cases while debugging, then detecting a single config file in my local directory isn't the perfect solution (as I'd need to rename the files to get it to auto-detect the configuration I'm testing). But maybe this isn't a use case for this feature. But I wanted to bring it up in case there is a way to support both use cases.\r\n\r\n`</brainstorm>`",
