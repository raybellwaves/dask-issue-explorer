    "body": "It is currently difficult to try out new shuffle plugins outside of\r\ndask because one cannot easily monkey-patch into all the places that\r\nthe top-level shuffle.shuffle method is imported within dask itself.\r\n\r\nTo enable external shuffle engines, introduce a registry of known\r\nshuffle methods that are tried in priority order. To register a new\r\nmethod, one must provide a function with the same signature as\r\nshuffle.shuffle, a priority (different from all existing registered\r\npriorities) and a function which decides (given the requested shuffle\r\nname, column(s) to shuffle on, and names of the dataframe columns)\r\nwhether or not a method is suitable.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
