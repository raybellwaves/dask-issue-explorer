        "body": "Just to emphasize, we believe the kernel gets restarted because of high memory use **before** any computation is started, we presume because the task graph is consuming memory. E.g., when I try this locally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nrandom_gt = da.random.choice(\r\n    np.array([0, 1, 2, 3]), \r\n    size=(300_000_000, 400, 2), \r\n    chunks=(200_000, 200, 2),\r\n    p=[0.95, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01])\r\nrandom_loc = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=random_gt.shape[0], dtype=bool)\r\ngc = da.compress(random_loc, random_gt, axis=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n...after executing the final line I see memory grow to >4G. This seems like a very simple task graph and so it doesn't seem like much memory should be required. I wonder if some data (`random_loc`?) is getting unnecessarily copied many times over.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to debug memory usage within the task graph?",

        "body": "I've done a bit of digging and think I have the source of the memory usage. There are two causes.\r\n\r\n(1) The first cause is that a boolean numpy index array is [converted internally into an integer index array via np.nonzero](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/9aec7794036a45088c8d98a9dc97143536fa4dd4/dask/array/slicing.py#L68). If there's a high density of True values in the boolean array, then calling nonzero will require quite a lot of memory for the 64-bit integers. This seems unnecessary, as it should be possible to just use boolean arrays without conversion to integers. Indeed, a dask boolean index array is supported directly without conversion to integers, so perhaps a numpy boolean index array could also be supported in a similar way. \r\n\r\n(2) The second cause is that the [integer index array is copied](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/9aec7794036a45088c8d98a9dc97143536fa4dd4/dask/array/slicing.py#L638) as part of ensuring all indices are positive. This could be avoided if there are no negative indices. \r\n\r\nFixing (2) looks easy, and probably worth doing anyway, but for this use case fixing (1) would be better. It wasn't immediately obvious how to implement a fix for (1), but happy to have a crack at it with some guidance.",
