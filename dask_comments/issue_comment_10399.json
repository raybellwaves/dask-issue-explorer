See forum post: https://dask.discourse.group/t/why-do-chunks-get-inverted/2131/3\r\n\r\nWhile I still encounter problems when using map_blocks with arrays of differing shapes, I have since found out that `dask.array.blockwise` can be used to address the problem outlined above. For example, the line `da.blockwise(foo, \"ijk\", arr_3d, \"ijk\", arr_2d, \"ij\")` does result in an array with the expected shape.",
