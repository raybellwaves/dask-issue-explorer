    "body": "This topic was brought up by @mrocklin on twitter: what best practices and guidelines should packages that depend on dask and other pydata packages follow? This was specifically brought up when talking about Satpy which is highly dependent on xarray DataArrays using dask arrays underneath. So the question is, what kind of things could be presented/documented to people wanting to build a package dependent on these dask/xarray/others. Some initial thoughts and questions I had:\r\n\r\n1. How/when to allow the user to define their own chunk sizes? With semi-recent updates for 'auto' chunking and setting chunks based on in-memory size this is easier, but still requires asking users to understand some low-level implementation details of a package.\r\n2. How/when should number of workers be configured by the package's user? Things like `OMP_NUM_THREADS` and `DASK_NUM_WORKERS` (or the related dask.config.set parameter).\r\n3. If the package wants to take the advantage of a distributed client (submit, gather, etc) what should the user be required to provide? Is it bad practice to use `get_client` inside the package's utilities to get any configured client? Should a user be required to provide a client? If not provided can/should a package create a local client? Is that too much magic happening without the user's knowledge (creating sub-processes, etc)?\r\n\r\nWhat other areas could these best practices include?\r\n\r\nCC @mraspaud (satpy core developer)",
