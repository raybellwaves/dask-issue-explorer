    "body": "I hit this more often than I'd care to admit when trying to write the dask-expr scheduler integration. This integration inevitably has to touch the code that is dealing with collections parsing and this is part of it.\r\n\r\nWhat's most concerning is that this unpack/repack code is not used consequently such that the unpack/repack in distributed, for instance, is behaving differently than the dask/dask equivalents.\r\n\r\nMost endusers will notice this change iff they are using base functions `optimize`, `persist`, `compute`, etc. Most users will not interact with this but instead with the methods on the collections.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# before will always return a tuple no matter what\r\n(d_opt,) = dask.optimize(d)\r\n\r\n# With this PR\r\nd_opt = dask.optimize(d)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will help me streamline implementation a little and I'm sure that new users will appreciate this. However, I'm very certain this will cause mild breakage somewhere.",
