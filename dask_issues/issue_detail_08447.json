Examples:\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8445\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8309\r\n* https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8306\r\n\r\nWe do want to get everything to Blockwise eventually, but our bandwith to track these down and fix them is limited. In the interim, I propose that by default, we still do low-level fusion when any of the layers in the graph are materialized.\r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora @ian-r-rose @jrbourbeau ",
