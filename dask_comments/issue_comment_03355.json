        "body": "In looking into this, found that `broadcast_shapes` needed some fixes for handling `nan`, which should be addressed with PR ( https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/3356 ). Seems that `broadcast_chunks` already handles `nan` chunks correctly, but had no tests for this behavior. So PR ( https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/3357 ) adds some tests. As `broadcast_arrays` relies on both of these currently, this should make some progress on this issue.",
