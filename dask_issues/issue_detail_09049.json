    "body": "Recently @rjzamora did some work to add a `from_map` API for Dask DataFrames in PR ( https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/8911 ). It might be interesting to consider a similar API for Dask Array. The [approach taken in Dask-Image's `imread`]( https://github.com/dask/dask-image/blob/890933e35f4f03157a7c3074dfc3cf2de2ab8b2e/dask_image/imread/__init__.py#L76-L99 ) might be a starting point for thinking about this.\r\n\r\ncc @dask/array",
