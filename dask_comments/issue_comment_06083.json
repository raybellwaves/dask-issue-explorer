My hope is that if we're pretty consistent about API then we might be able to be both fast and flexible.  For example, for the dependencies problem maybe they always have the following structure:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndsk, dependencies = my_func(dsk, dependencies)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe there is always an explicit `ensure_dict` step to split between high and low level graphs (Although this breaks with the above rule maybe).",
