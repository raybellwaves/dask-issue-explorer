    "body": "We have several tests, e.g. `dask/dataframe/tests/test_dataframe.py::test_dataframe_groupby_cumsum_agg_empty_partitions`, that ensure our collections algorithm's can handle empty partitions. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/1270f068c03c3162102da1f606397c5d958c9b85/dask/dataframe/tests/test_dataframe.py#L4855-L4859\r\n\r\nHowever, these tests often don't have an explicit check that empty partitions are present. I'd like to see us add a new testing utility function that we can use to help ensure we're testing the corner case that we intent to. For example, something like (the snippet below is untested):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef assert_empty_partitions(df):\r\n    assert df.map_partitions(lambda x: x.empty).compute().all()\r\n```\r\n\r\nMarking this as a nice-to-have, but low priority item ",
