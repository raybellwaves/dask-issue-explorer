        "body": "There are 2 potential solutions here:\r\n\r\n- Cast decimals to floats while reading, which is incorrect obviously but provides a better ux\r\n\r\n- Ensure that Decimals work smoothly in pandas and then in Dask DataFrames\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me how long this would take. There is very very little test coverage for Arrow decimals in pandas at the moment. The type itself works, but I don't know how It interacts with other parts of the API.\r\n\r\nThere is another issue that is potentially more of a problem. pandas has a bunch of Cython algorithms (for groupby stuff for example) that don't have any decimal support and probably won't get there anytime soon. So we would have to cast to floats anyway along the way if we don't implement this properly or find a way to dispatch to arrow for these computations (unlikely in the short term).\r\n\r\n> I don't actually know where this goes. Arrow? Pandas? Dask DataFrame? Hopefully we find a good answer here.\r\n\r\nDefinitely pandas and Dask DataFrane",
