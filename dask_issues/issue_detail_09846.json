    "body": "i would like to request something like np.fill_diagonal for dask\r\n\r\nAny pointers on how I could go about implementing this on my own would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe best i have come across SO is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51713725/what-is-the-equivalent-of-np-fill-diagonal-in-dask which mentions using map_block but I am unsure of the logic to put inside the function passed to map_block\r\n\r\nFor a minimal example implemented in numpy that I wish to take over to dask:\r\n```\r\ndef update_diagonal(matrix, num, lr, i):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Description:\r\n        Updates the diagonal of the input matrix\r\n    Inputs:\r\n        matrix: Input diagonal matrix.\r\n        num            : Number of rows/columns.\r\n        lr          : Learning rate.\r\n        i           : ith iteration\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    np.fill_diagonal(matrix, np.nan)\r\n    matrix_std = np.nanstd(matrix, axis=0, ddof=0)\r\n    matrix_fill = matrix_std * i * math.exp(2 * lr * step)\r\n    np.fill_diagonal(matrix, matrix_fill)\r\n    return matrix\r\n\r\n```\r\nThanks for the great work on dask. it has really helped in my project",
