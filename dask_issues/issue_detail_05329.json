    "body": "I'm opening this on the dask board as it is the first package that came up with the idea of the _meta property, but this is really of interest of all NEP18-compatible packages that wrap around other NEP18 packages.\r\n\r\nI'm in the early stages of a project where I will likely need to use xarray, pint, dask, and sparse within the same object. In addition to this, I believe I saw on the sparse board some discussion about using CuPy (or similar) for GPU acceleration.\r\n\r\nThis could potentially translate to\r\n_an xarray.DataArray\r\nthat wraps around a pint.Quantity\r\nthat wraps around a dask.array.Array\r\nthat wraps around a sparse.COO\r\nthat wraps around a cupy.array_\r\n\r\nand in theory, _it should just work_ as long as all the libraries in the stack implement the relevant numpy functions.\r\n\r\nIdeally, as a final user I would like to see all of this information when invoking repr() on my top level object, something like\r\n```\r\n<xarray.DataArray (x: 100)>\r\n<pint.Quantity::dask.array::sparse.COO::cupy.array, \r\n unit=\"seconds\", dtype=int64, nnz=2, fill_value=0, Device=0>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis thread is to understand:\r\n1. how to best represent this kind of arbitrarily nested meta data,  both as a data structure and as a ``__repr__`` \r\n2. if it should be formalized through a NEP\r\n\r\n@shoyer \r\n@keewis\r\n@hameerabbasi \r\n@mrocklin ",
