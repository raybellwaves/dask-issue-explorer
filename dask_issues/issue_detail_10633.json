Many functions that can be imported from those modules will likely not work on a dask-expr DataFrame.\r\n\r\nOne proposal would be to drop all submodules in favor of allowing only imports from `dask.dataframe.__init__.py` and renaming all submodules s.t. they have an underscore signaling it to be private API.\r\n\r\nThe feature toggle could then easily be implemented at this central place and we could introduce proper deprecation warnings.\r\n\r\nxref https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-expr/issues/374",
