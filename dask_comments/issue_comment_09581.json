        "body": "Thanks for opening this issue up @ncclementi \r\n\r\n> in dask-gateway cluster\r\n\r\nLet's think more broadly about how to use these plugins on an arbitrary Dask cluster (I think we would write the same docs regardless of what tool is being used to deploy the cluster -- e.g. `dask-gateway`, `dask-kubernetes`, `coiled`, `dask-cloudprovider`, etc)\r\n\r\n> Create documentation providing concrete examples on how to install custom code that is in a private artifactory, simple script, github repository modules, etc.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the common things I see users needing are:\r\n\r\n- Install some specific package from PyPI / conda channel\r\n- Install some specific package from a private PyPI server / conda channel (this is a special case of the above that requires pointing `pip` / `conda` to where they should look for packages) \r\n- Make sure some local Python module with utility functions is available on their cluster\r\n\r\nIf we can cover these cases, then we should be good (at least to start)\r\n\r\n> Note: CustomWorkerPlugin is a user-defined plugin. Usually used when code is in github and not in artifactory\r\n\r\nI think folks can just use `PipInstall` for this and point directly to GitHub. Though I might be missing something...\r\n",
