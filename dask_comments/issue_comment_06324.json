Looking at the values I'm inferring that the issue is that the shapes don't match, but that's not clearly spelled out here in the same way that it would if we had the full traceback and saw a line like `assert x.shape == y.shape`.  My guess is that this could be resolved by improving the assertion messages even more, which seems like a good idea regardless.",
