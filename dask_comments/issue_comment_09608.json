        "body": "Thanks for the issue and reproducer, @jbcurtin \r\n\r\nI'm trying to wrap my head around this. Your dataframe has 200,000 rows and 100 partitions, so each partition is 2000 rows.\r\n\r\nAnd so by \"window-range > window frame\", you mean that the \"size of the rolling window\" is larger than the number of rows in a partition. Indeed this appears to be the case when in window size is 3,000:\r\n\r\nContinuing from your example:\r\n```python\r\nfor f in futures:\r\n    print(f.result().isnull().all())\r\n\r\n# False\r\n# False\r\n# True\r\n# True\r\n# True\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I have this right, you could (possibly) repartition your dataframe to match your window size as a work around. But I imagine there are cases where this isn't feasible. I also imagine there this a more robust and general fix that could go into the library. This isn't something I can take on right now, but I'll make sure someone with more experience sees this issue.",
