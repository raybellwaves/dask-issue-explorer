    "body": "The NumPy FFT functions optionally take a [`norm` argument]( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.fft.html#normalization ). Would be good if the Dask Array functions also optionally took that argument and only passed it on if it was not `None` (the default). This because it is easier to support other functions that don't take `norm` if we don't require that argument. Alternatively, this might be best addressed as arbitrary keyword argument as proposed in issue ( https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/3278 ).",
