    "body": "__Proposal: Add generic support for exploratory workflows__\r\n\r\n\r\nIn big data pipelines, various variants of a specific operator may be\r\nconsidered. For instance, the variants are related to a data cleaning\r\nstrategy or a parameter of a learning algorithm. We refer to such\r\npipelines as exploratory workflows, as it is not know apriori which\r\noperator variants shall be considered. Choosing an inappropriate\r\nvariant, however, may render the result of the workflow useless, so that\r\ncomputational resources may be wasted.\r\n\r\nThe [linked proposal](https://github.com/bielefem/MDF-Proposal/blob/master/proposal.md) describes a way to handle such\r\nexploratory workflows more efficiently.\r\n",
