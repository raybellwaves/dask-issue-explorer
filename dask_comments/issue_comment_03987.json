An other function will take all of those and create a new array and do the assignment. I Think that is within the realm of dask since assignment only happens to newly created arrays.\r\n\r\n2. Not too sure. It probably wasn't any slower than block. I think ultimately it failed at handling one of my cases, so I couldn't use it. \r\n\r\nI just wanted to point somebody to a `no concatenate` solution to this problem.",

        "body": "FWIW a lot of the code for `block` was lifted from NumPy. This was done to avoid NumPy usages of `asarray`, which trigger a computation, or things like `concatenate`, where a Dask friendly implementation is needed. If there have been changes in NumPy, that would help Dask, it is probably reasonable to update our vendored copy. Better yet if we can consolidate code between the two, but that likely isn't possible without NumPy addressing `asarray` and `concatenate` for this use case in a nicer way.",

I kinda messed up with the review process, but it might help if you put your thoughts here: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11971 You can just read the top and bottom and skip the middle\r\n\r\nThe secondary challenge was that the existing benchmarks were hard to interpret https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12001 and a bug in the existing implementation made one benchmark made my proposed implementation look so much worse than the existing one https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11979\r\n\r\nUltimately, different algorithms are applicable for different datasets. For blocking small arrays (512x512 final size), it actually turned out that `concatenate` is much faster than scanning over all the data.\r\n\r\nDask also offers alot of optimizations like this notion of squashing linear operations. I still need to experiment with it, but initial benchmarks https://github.com/dask/dask-benchmarks/pull/18 show that there isn't much more than 10% to be gained.",
