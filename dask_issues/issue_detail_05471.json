The GitHub functionality for watching releases doesn't work for the Dask project as the releases are only created as tags, not [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-releases). The [blog](https://blog.dask.org/) also doesn't seem to be updated for each release.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have an alerting system for every release. I often only find out about a new version by our internal GitLab CI throwing errors, e.g. due to https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/5465.\r\n\r\n",
