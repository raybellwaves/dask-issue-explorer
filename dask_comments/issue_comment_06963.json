Sorry nobody got back to you @syagev\r\n\r\n> A notable example is that when the majority of the work is GIL-intensive (i.e. does not free-up the GIL very often), then the best-practice is to run workers with nthreads=1\r\n\r\n`distributed` recently added support for running tasks in different types of `concurrent.futures.Executors`. Previously tasks were always run in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` which is why using a single-threaded task executor was recommended before. However, today for GIL-intensive tasks you might try using a `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead to avoid GIL-contention. For a nice example of how to do this, you could look at the gist / video posted in https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/5059",
