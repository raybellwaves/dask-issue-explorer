    "body": "Hi folks, I'm Devin from the Modin group.\r\n\r\nBetween our groups, I believe there's a high potential for collaboration and improving the data science experience for Dask and Modin users. Due to the complexity/differences in the architectures of Dask and Modin Dataframes, there's a lot to consider. I'll outline a proposal for next steps here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Step 1: Interoperability between Modin and other Dask libraries** \r\n* Conversion of Modin Dataframe to:\r\n  * Dask Dataframe\r\n  * Dask Array\r\n  * Other useful structures? There's a power law with Dask's other structures so it probably makes sense to prioritize based on commonality\r\n* Interoperability between Modin Dataframe and Dask XGBoost\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Learn from each other**\r\n* Are there issues that are unable to be compromised (e.g. must sort row label values, must support certain operators, etc.)?\r\n* What do Dask/Modin Dataframe users care about?\r\n* What does Dask/Modin Dataframe allow that Modin/Dask does not?\r\n* Is there enough overlap in our goals to combine forces?\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Combining forces**\r\n* How to do this will be based on Step 2 outcomes\r\n\r\nSteps 1 and 2 can be worked on simultaneously. Regardless of the Step 2 outcomes I think Step 1 is a no-brainer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere are my high level thoughts:\r\n* I would like Modin's users to be able to use other Dask objects and utilities\r\n* I think Dask Dataframe users would benefit from the academic research work we've done (some yet unpublished)\r\n* I also think there are engineering features that Modin has that would interest Dask Dataframe users as well\r\n",
