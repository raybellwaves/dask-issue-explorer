        "body": "The default assumption for the `metadata` is a `RangeIndex` (by Dask).\r\n\r\nHowever, the final answer can have either `RangeIndex` or `MultiIndex`. This is a `pandas` problem and is unrelated to `dask`. Basically, after applying `nlargest(K)` on a grouped pandas DataFrame, if the result is all of the rows i.e. each group having K rows = the input data itself, we get a `RangeIndex` through pandas.\r\n\r\nIf the above is not the case, we get a `MultiIndex`.\r\n\r\nNow, this seems fine, but while using the `Apply-Concat-Apply` paradigm, it is possible that some blocks of data return the `RangeIndex` while some return the `MultiIndex`.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't allow us to normally concatenate different blocks.\r\n\r\n(unlike in https://blog.dask.org/2019/10/08/df-groupby where the `sr3` block has it's output as all of the rows of input.\r\nThus, it is consistent with `sr1` and `sr2` in terms of retaining it's index and all `3` of them can be concatenated easily).\r\n\r\nComing back to `nlargest`, since the indexes of different blocks are different. That's why there is a `if-else` block in this PR in the `_nlargest_chunk` function that accounts for this, and converts the `RangeIndex` to a `MultiIndex`, so that different blocks can be concatenated.\r\n\r\nWhat I am essentially trying to say is that my implementation respects the output (as `pandas` wants it) i.e. `RangeIndex` or `MultiIndex` depending on the data and the `K` in `nlargest(K)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure how to deal with this `metadata` issue. Hence, I am changing the test simply from `nlargest(1)` to `nlargest(2)`. This way, the result would indeed contain a `RangeIndex` and would thus respect the default settings for metadata as set by dask (i.e. a `RangeIndex` indeed).",

        "body": "@TomAugspurger @mrocklin I have modified the test a bit. It is possible that although both `pandas` and `dask` return the correct results, their order might be different (due to splitting in chunks and concatenating and re-applying). Further, the final result can have a `RangeIndex`, a `MultiIndex` or even an `Int64Index`. Thus, to account for equality of the results, I have converted the outputs to dictionaries and then compared them.\r\n\r\nI have also added a total of 24 tests in the latest commit. Hopefully, this should suffice.\r\n\r\nEdit: Since the output can be any of `RangeIndex`, a `MultiIndex`, etc. Thus, we cannot know the `metadata` of the index beforehand. (Plus the type of index can vary for each chunk as well). Hence, the test uses `assert` (and not `assert_eq`) and compares the outputs directly by converting them to `dicts`. ",
