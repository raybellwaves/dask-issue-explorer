    "body": "In https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/9731, we added a test that checks that certain packages installed are a nightly/dev/release candidate/etc. version (only runs in our `upstream` build)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/e6511215a025bf8ac967bab6955cecadd83322c1/dask/tests/test_ci.py#L12-L38\r\n\r\nThis works great for packages that have a dedicated nightly conda channel or PyPI index. However, the logic in this test can fail for packages that use `git` tags to determine versions (e.g. versionseer) when installed directly from GitHub as the latest `main` branch can sometimes point to a released version of the project.\r\n\r\nFor now we've temporarily commented out these impacted projects, but it'd be great if we could update things to work for those cases. \r\n",
