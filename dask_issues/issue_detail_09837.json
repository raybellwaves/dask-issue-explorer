If I connect to a Coiled cluster, it fails as soon as I try computing the dataframe, stating that the oss profile does not exist.\r\nAt the moment of writing, I could not find a clean solution.\r\n\r\n**Workaround:** rename the `[oss]` profile to `[default]` in `~/.aws/credentials` and don't pass any parameters in Python.\r\nI *think* that this causes the initial `read_parquet` call - which runs locally - to read the `role_arn` from my credentials, and then when the chunks are loaded remotely on the Coiled cluster there's *a different role_arn* that has been pre-set there?",
