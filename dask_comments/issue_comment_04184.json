        "body": "Sure. It'll be somewhat similar to rolling: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/6c7f42f2d9d0b76dd2520f1da2050b7aa463420a/dask/dataframe/rolling.py#L183\r\n\r\nBut the method for choosing the window will be different. I believe it will be decently more involved, since we aren't just finding an overlap between two partitions. I think every partition will need to get values from every other partition, since every value influences the result, just with some diminishing weight the further out in time.",
