        "body": "Thanks for the issue @Joachimoe. There are definitely differences like these between NumPy and Dask. The docstring for the Dask version of `rot90` was automatically copied from `np.rot90` with the added disclaimer\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis docstring was copied from numpy.rot90.\r\n\r\nSome inconsistencies with the Dask version may exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect you're correct that Dask isn't using views like NumPy does. In this case, I'd recommend we add relevant information on this discrepancy to the `inconsistencies=` keyword added to `@derived_from` decorator that's wrapping `das.rot90`. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/7e263dd486e5a9317897e8bbde8801614e67aea4/dask/utils.py#L818-L843\r\n\r\n`@derived_from` is where we auto-copy docstrings into Dask ",
