    "body": "This improves performance when writing out arrays with a very large number of chunks.\r\n\r\nI made this change based on profiling and debugging. I found that in my case, where `regions = (<empty slice>, <empty slice>, <empty slice>)`, `[fuse_slice(region, slc) for slc in slices]` appears to be an identity (`slices == [fuse_slice(region, slc) for slc in slices]`). However, it takes a very long time to run.\r\n\r\nThat said, **I don't have a good grasp on either `fuse_slice`, or `insert_to_ooc`, so I'm not sure if this is correct in the first place, and if so, if this is the right place to put this logic.** So I created this PR mainly to solicit feedback from someone who understands this in better detail. Thank you!\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx\r\n- [ ] Tests added / passed\r\n- [ ] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
