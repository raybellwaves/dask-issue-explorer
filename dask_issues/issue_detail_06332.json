    "body": "When profiling large task graphs it can be difficult to tell which tasks correspond to which function calls in the user's code. The function name is fairly generic (e.g. \"sum-aggregate\") and often not enough to tie down the originating call.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to add caller information like the filename and line number to the task information, so it can be displayed in the web interface. Caller information should also be retrievable in diagnostics code, such as callbacks: https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/diagnostics-local.html#custom-callbacks.\r\n\r\nImplementation-wise I think there are two parts: 1. where in Dask do we capture the call stack? 2. where do we store it so it's accessible in diagnostics code?",
