    "body": "A non-trivial fraction of our scheduling overhead comes from calculating dependencies of the task graph.  We currently do this redundantly in a few places.  A while ago we changed many of the optimization functions to return both a task graph and the dependencies so that this can be passed along to other optimizations.  However, the full `dd.optimize` or `da.optimize` functions don't do this, they only return the task graph.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to change this, so that top-level optimization functions also return dependencies.  This will help us to reduce overhead costs.  However, this also is a break to top-level API and will break user code from some more advanced users and so perhaps warrants some discussion.\r\n\r\ncc @shoyer @jcrist ",
