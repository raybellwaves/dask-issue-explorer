This makes me think that the source if these failures is outside of `dask/dask` itself. \r\n\r\nThe next thing I would do here is `diff` the installed packages between the successful builds in https://github.com/dask/dask/commit/fd31b9b67e105f4c63b391f5c24959e39e27a0cc vs. the unsuccessful builds [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/actions/runs/4682910082/jobs/8297351447) and [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/actions/runs/4682910082/jobs/8297351582) to see what dependencies have changed. Hopefully that helps provide some insight. \r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora @charlesbluca @phofl @graingert is this something you have bandwidth to look into? ",
