        "body": "I would also love to see that and I especially love your solution, @mariusvniekerk! \r\nIs there a particular reason you were writing your \"own\" (Thrift) connection and not using something like `pyhive` or `sqlalchemy`? Because in principle, the information you are requesting via thrift can also be queried with a `DESCRIBE FORMATTED <table>` call and then all the version compatibility and authentication is already fixed by another package. That might simplify testing.\r\n(Side note: the output format is then a bit confusing, but [can](https://github.com/nils-braun/dask-sql/blob/main/dask_sql/input_utils/hive.py#L154) be parsed).\r\n\r\nI know that blazingSQL needed to implement something similar (but only \"similar\", because they have their own input functions) and I have also implemented something like this in dask-sql (honestly, because I was not aware of your repo!) using pyhive/sqlalchemy. Do you think it would make sense to combine these efforts (I have seen your last commit was in 2017)? With thrift or pyhive or both? I would be happy to help here.",
