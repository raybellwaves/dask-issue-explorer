        "body": "Opened #9944 to fix the chained indexing failures. Found 7 more:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_attrs_series_in_dataframes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test works now, so would have to conditionally xfail?\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest_split_apply_combine_on_series\r\ntest_apply_or_transform_shuffle\r\ntest_apply_or_transform_shuffle_multilevel\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose tests fail for the same configurations (2 each). The following happens there:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\" [1, 2, 3], \"b\": 1})\r\ndf.groupby(df[\"b\"]).sum()\r\n```\r\n\r\npandas identifies that your column is part from your DataFrame (as does Dask) and so the aggregation is not computed over it. This works as expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\" [1, 2, 3], \"b\": 1})\r\ndf.groupby(df[\"b\"] + 1).sum()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the groupby key is not a part of the initial DataFrame, e.g. you'll end up with a result where the index is named b and you have 2 aggregation columns, a and b again. Dask right now does not add b to the columns again (it does without CoW).\r\n\r\nEdit: I used the current pandas nightly",
