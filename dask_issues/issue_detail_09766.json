It might mimic things like \r\nthe following (in increasing order of difficulty):\r\n\r\n1.  Data types\r\n2. Number of rows (per partition?)\r\n3. Cardinality (per partition?)\r\n4. Sortedness\r\n5. Distribution of values beyond cardinality\r\n6. ...\r\n\r\nWe would do a single full pass of the data to create a recipe and then people could share that recipe \r\n\r\nSome of these might still be sensitive (cardinality might leak number of users for example).  In general though this might be helpful?  No pressure, just a thought.",
