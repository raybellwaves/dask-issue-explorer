It would be good to be more generic here and just talk about IB. cc @pentschev in case you have thoughts\r\n\r\nThis may be useful, I'm only not sure if there are any non-GPU InfiniBand users out there currently. We can always say using `protocol=\"ucx\"` will enable InfiniBand support (although IPoIB may be available for those machines where IB interfaces have proper routing/IP addresses configured even without UCX and the user explicitly identifies the `ibX` network interface for comms), but I'm not currently aware of any CPU-only benchmarking either, although I think this is something we could do.\r\n\r\nDo you have something more specific in mind you would like to have documented other than the general guidelines I mentioned above?",

Pointing users to it seems like a great idea, we would essentially need to tell them to use `protocol=\"ucx\"` and specify `--interface` pointing scheduler and workers to an IB interface, that should be all. The only point I was trying to make previously is that we (RAPIDS) haven't tested CPU-only workflows with IB, but there's no reason to believe they wouldn't work.",
