        "body": "Btw I feel like I'm doing something wrong in the example above, because the two graphs (the graph creating `x` and the graph creating `result`) are not explicitly connected, i.e., dask is not aware of the dependencies between chunks in `result` and chunks in `x`, and so cannot do any intelligent scheduling, e.g., to avoid recomputing chunks in `x`. I guess there is a way to do this properly, i.e., construct a graph where each chunk in `windows` is connected to the chunk (or chunks) that it needs to read from `x`. Any advice appreciated.",
