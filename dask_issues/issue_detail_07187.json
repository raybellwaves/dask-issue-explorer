    "body": "This is left over from #3595; there were some discussions there about ways to improve `da.compute` that I think shouldn't be forgotten. The below all applies to arrays and the threaded scheduler; I don't have any experience with data frames or distributed so maybe it's applicable there too.\r\n\r\nComputing an array involves computing all the individual chunks, followed by a concatenation (at least last time I looked; it's been a while since I poked in that area of the code). On the other hand, `da.store` writes completed chunks to the output array. That makes it both faster and more memory-efficient to replace use of `compute` with `np.empty` + `store`. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport dask\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\n\r\ndef compute(b):\r\n    b.compute()\r\n\r\ndef compute_by_store(b):\r\n    x = np.empty(b.shape, b.dtype)\r\n    da.store([b], [x], lock=False)\r\n\r\na = da.ones(4 * 10**9, dtype=np.uint8, chunks=10**7)\r\nb = a * 3\r\nt0 = time.monotonic()\r\ncompute(b)\r\nt1 = time.monotonic()\r\ncompute_by_store(b)\r\nt2 = time.monotonic()\r\nprint(f'Compute: {t1 - t0:.3f}\\nStore:   {t2 - t1:.3f}')\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nCompute: 1.370\r\nStore:   0.788\r\n```\r\n\r\nMemory usage is also halved by compute_by_store.\r\n\r\nThat's obviously a somewhat contrived example where the concatenation dominates the run-time, but I've seen significant difference in real-world use cases too.",
