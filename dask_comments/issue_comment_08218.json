Even using `client.map` it seems unusual to call compute within the function that you are trying to distribute. I just don't see what the value of that is. If you are using `Pool` already then why not just use `numpy.Array` and skip dask altogether?",

        "body": "@jsignell cheers muchly for getting back to me! That is just a toy example to show what the setup is within our stack - there is a process that needs to call a function that should `compute()` at the same time when another process is sending the same function to mpi via `Pool` - don't worry about fixing the toy example, in the actual setup things are way more complicated but it boils down to this basic chain of events. The question here is why isn't the function sent to mpi finishing its job (unlike the one that is sent via the dask distributed, that finishes fine) :beer: ",
