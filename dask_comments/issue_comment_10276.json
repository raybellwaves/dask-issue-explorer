        "body": "@martindurant is there a recommendation for this right now? My current solution is to constrain s3fs>=2023.3.0 in conda. \r\nAnd @fjetter, regarding the warning in [10397](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/10397), am I reading it right that this will give a warning for s3fs<=0.5? Because right now without any pins conda resolves s3fs=0.6.0, which results in `[this error](https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8335)` again,",
