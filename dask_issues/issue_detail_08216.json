While before, the DataFrame was converted to a float ndarray (because it also has a float columns), not giving those overflow issues. Hence the test was failing (see test `dask/dataframe/tests/test_ufunc.py::test_ufunc_with_reduction`). The question here is whether dask wants to follow that behaviour.",
