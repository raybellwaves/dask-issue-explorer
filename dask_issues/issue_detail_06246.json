    "body": "https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6066 recently added a `DataFrame.shuffle`\r\nmethod for partitioning a dataframe by one or more columns based on the hash of\r\nthe column's values. All rows with an equal has will end up in the same partition.\r\n\r\nHow should this be exposed to users through the DataFrame data model? At the\r\nmoment, `.shuffle()` just results in a complex task graph (and perhaps the\r\nclearing of `.divisions`).\r\n\r\n1. How should this affect `.divisions`? The current semantics and implementation\r\n   of `.divisions` doesn't handle hash-based, column partitioning. The semantics\r\n   are off, since we don't actually sort the data by the (hashed) values. And we\r\n   might partition by multiple columns, so we might want a 2-D structure to\r\n   whatever concept generalizes `.divisions`.\r\n2. As usual with data model questions: how should this affect the repr?\r\n\r\nSorry for just raising questions and no answers thus far. I'll think on it some more.\r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora.",
