I'm not very familiar with dask and I'm still unsure if one instance of `Cache` is intended be used across multiple threads. Discussion on #10396 suggests it is intended, but the local scheduler's code made me reconsider that.\r\n2\\. We solved one instance of this problem over on napari in a different way (by moving all cached access to a dedicated non-main thread in https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/6008).\r\n3\\. This doesn't solve all potential concurrency issues with use of `Cache`. I think I can see another one caused by interleaving of `_start` accessing the cache and `_posttask` modifying it.\r\n",
