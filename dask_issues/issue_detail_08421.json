Get better performance by turning this off.\".\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this has to do with the fact that Dask does not implement the `as_index` parameter, so the group keys are always the index and therefore sorted. But this should be reflected in the `sort` doc, removed completely, or `as_index=False` should be supported.\r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nThe row with group key/index `B` is still sorted before `A` after the `.last()` computation.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom dask.dataframe import from_pandas\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame([['2021-11-24', 'B'], ['2021-11-25', 'A']], columns=['DATE', 'HASH'])\r\n\r\nresult = from_pandas(df, npartitions=1).groupby('HASH', sort=False).last().compute()\r\nprint(result)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n            DATE\r\nHASH            \r\nA     2021-11-25\r\nB     2021-11-24\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nI also tried it with [Dask 2.11.0 / 2020-02-19](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/changelog.html#id128) where the `sort` argument was first exposed for `groupby`, and even there it is not working as intended.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2021.11.2\r\n- Python version: 3.9\r\n- Operating System: Window 10\r\n- Install method: pip\r\n",
