This is necessary when splitting large files into chunks, since the header is applied to each chunk.\r\n\r\nI do not immediately see a combination of parameters that gets around this (perhaps someone else knows), but if you do not need to split up your files, you could do something like this:\r\n```\r\ndf = dd.from_delayed([dask.delayed(pd.read_csv)(f) for f in filelist])\r\n```\r\n(the dataframe pieces will still have their internal ordering of columns differently, but that won't matter when almost everything works by selecting columns by label)",

        "body": "> but If it can't be fixed it should produce an error (or at least a warning).\r\n\r\nI agree that it should do this.  There are literally dozens of cases with malformed CSV where it would be useful to provide informative errors.  Unfortunately there is no way to make the directory-of-csv format entirely reliable without looking through all of the data ahead of time.  There is a necessary trade-off here between \"get going quickly\" and \"thoroughly check through all of the data for inconsistencies\".\r\n\r\nIf you have thoughts on how to improve the current internal design of `dd.read_csv` and the time to implement those changes then contributions would be most welcome.\r\n",
