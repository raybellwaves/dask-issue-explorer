        "body": "@tilign thanks for the interest in the async side of dask!  A few things:\r\n\r\n1) you can easily create a client with the following:\r\n```python\r\nfrom distributed import Client\r\nclient = Client(asynchronous=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo need to go through `LocalCluster` but if you prefer that, that's ok!\r\n\r\n2) I think the issue is related to async interface.  It's good to remember that you can await futures directly or you can use the client interface like the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nawait client.compute(bag.map(lambda x: x))\r\n```",
