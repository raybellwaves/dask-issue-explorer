    "body": "These are some of the oldest methods in `dask.array`, and stylistically\r\nno longer matched much of the codebase. The implementation was also\r\novercomplicated to support `ones` and `ones_like` with the same wrapper\r\ncode, even though we no longer used the `ones_like` defined in that file\r\n(that had since moved to `da.creation` from `da.wrap`). The wrapping\r\ncode also didn't properly handle the differences between `*args` and\r\n`**kwargs` well, leading to issues if e.g. `dtype` was passed as an\r\n`arg` not a `kwarg`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes all of that, removing the old code in `wrap`, and moving\r\neverything under `da.creation`.\r\n`da.ones`/`da.zeros`/`da.full`/`da.empty` all have proper signatures\r\nnow, and the underlying implementation is much simpler.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a bug where calling `da.full(large_shape, 1)` with no `dtype`\r\nwould actually create that array in memory when inferring the dtype.\r\n\r\nFixes #6275.\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `black dask` / `flake8 dask`\r\n",
