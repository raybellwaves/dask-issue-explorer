This gives me the result that I want but after the multiply the partitions in my dask dataframe are reduced from 124 to 2 and then any operations after the the multiply fail due to a memory error. I'm just wondering if there is a way to stop this repartition or another approach I can take to give the desired output without and wouldn't repartition.",
