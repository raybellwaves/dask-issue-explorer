This can result in very large chunks, which break computation.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\nx = da.ones((1000000, 1))\r\ny = da.ones((1, 1000000))\r\nz = x.dot(y)\r\nz\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndask.array<tensordot, shape=(1000000, 1000000), dtype=float64, chunksize=(1000000, 1000000), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these situations we should probably take a look at the output chunk sizes, and consider rechunking preemptively.  \r\n\r\n(we probably wanted to do this)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nz = x.rechunk((2000, 1)).dot(y.rechunk((1, 2000)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the value of 2000 was determined by looking at `dask.config.get(\"array.chunksize\")`\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to do this in a way that didn't require going through all `n x m` chunk outputs (or greater if there we're doing outer products with more axes), but instead in a way that only required going through `n + m` values.\r\n\r\ncc @tomwhite",
