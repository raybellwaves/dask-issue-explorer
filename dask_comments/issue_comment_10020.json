        "body": "TL;DR: Cache invalidation is hard. Spread the word about caching (and invalidation) on CI and document it in a place where it's easy to discover (likely https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/develop.html#dask-ci-infrastructure), then things will be fine.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, caching works great most of the time. It's just that when it causes problems, it gets kind of cryptic if you don't know what's happening. I had an issue with this when we merged the PRs for P2P rechunk where changes merged into `dask/dask` would not appear on `dask/distributed` CI due to caching. It took me a while to realize that caching was the culprit and how to invalidate the caches. Documenting such a scenario as a common gotcha and how to resolve this would be beneficial.",
