        "body": "I did think about `numeric_only` a while ago. Trying to recall... It looks like I added a decorator that tries to get a performance gain by getting the relevant columns before passing the data to the method. So probably the first step would be to add the decorator to the `quantile` method and set the `numeric_only` kwarg on `quantile` to None. It looks like quantile is implemented for time-like dtypes. For instance in your example above you can do `ddf.date.quantile` and you get an output. Let me open a PR.",
