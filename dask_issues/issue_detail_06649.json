    "body": "**What happened**:\r\nWhile playing around with rechunking and `map_blocks` I started getting results which I couldn't readily explain. Specifically, the way empty chunks get handled in a `map_blocks` call (and probably in `blockwise`) after a `rechunk` seems to generate very peculiar results. \r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\nI would expect empty chunks to be passed in as an empty array or `None`.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\n\r\na = da.ones(5)\r\nb = a.rechunk({0: (0, 5, 0)})\r\nc = b.map_blocks(lambda x: x, dtype=int)\r\n\r\nprint(c.compute())\r\n# ['1.0' '1.0' '1.0' '1.0' '1.0'\r\n#  'rechunk-merge-6fad39db5dc73de6e4bc404c4ae4dbbb' '1'\r\n#  'rechunk-merge-6fad39db5dc73de6e4bc404c4ae4dbbb' '2']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nThe above would not be all that surprising if the numerical values were between the task names - that would at least suggest that the chunks were correctly aligned with the task, e.g.:\r\n```python\r\n# ['rechunk-merge-6fad39db5dc73de6e4bc404c4ae4dbbb' '0'\r\n#  '1.0' '1.0' '1.0' '1.0' '1.0'\r\n#  'rechunk-merge-6fad39db5dc73de6e4bc404c4ae4dbbb' '2']\r\n```\r\nI was attempting to use this behaviour to manufacture chunks in cases where the input is sparse and you don't necessarily have data in every chunk. I also appreciate that this might not be the best way of doing things, but I found this result interesting and confusing enough to maybe flag as a bug.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2.26.0\r\n- Python version: 3.6.9\r\n- Operating System: Pop!_OS 18.04 LTS\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): pip\r\n",
