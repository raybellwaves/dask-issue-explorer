If you change it to `iloc`, everything works OK. On the fastparquet side, `sorted_partitioned_columns` only produces output for **non-overlapping** values. This could perhaps be changed, but I think it conforms to the expectations of dataframe divisions.\r\n\r\nAlso note that pd.to_parquet works just fine with append and fastparquet, because it doesn't care about the index at all.",
