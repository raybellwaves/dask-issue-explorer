        "body": "Sorry I missed this @jrbourbeau - Do you have a strong motivation in mind here? Right now, `dd.from_dict` is very simple and easy to maintain. I suppose the only \"issue\" is that the code would need to do a lot more than `dd.from_pandas(pd.DataFrame.from_dict(input), npartitions=npartitions)`.  However, it seems okay to be more sophisticated if we need to be.\r\n\r\nI think the only important consideration is that the cudf-backend version may also need to change a bit.",
