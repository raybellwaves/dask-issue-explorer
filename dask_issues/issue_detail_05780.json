    "body": "Dask's new [performance reports](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/diagnosing-performance.html#performance-reports) are very useful for understanding performance of an individual job.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am looking at analyzing a large number of jobs and trying to understand, in aggregate, which operations should I try to speed up to get the greatest overall performance improvement.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if in addition to an HTML file, the performance report could be exported as CSV or JSON or other format easier to analyze with scripts.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the task stream and worker profile data is of interest for this analysis.\r\n\r\nFor the task stream, a useful JSON format would be something like:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n {worker_1: [{timestamp: '01/10/2020 12:00:00', read_parquet: 3.06}, {timestamp: .., transfer-drop-duplicates...: 10s}..]},\r\n {worker_2: [{timestamp:.., read_parquet: 2.04}, {timestamp:.., transfer-drop-duplicates...: 13s}..]\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the worker profile, something like:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n{row: 0, Name: '', Filename: '', Line_number: 0, Line: '', Time: 80.03, Percentage: 100.0},\r\n{row: 1, Name: 'read_parquet_part', Filename: '/home/user/conda/env/my_env/lib/python3.7/dask/dataframe/io/parquet/core.py', Line_number: 259, Line: ..., Time: 58.08, Percentage: 72.3}\r\n...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm presently working on a parser for the HTML file, but Bokeh's large blog of JSON isn't very straightforward. If others have looked into this already, I'm eager to hear what worked for them.",
