        "body": "I think the issue is in `map_partitions`. To support\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf.div(val, axis=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `val` is a pandas or dask Series, we need to align with `df`. We don't want to do this for `axis=1`. For `.div` style binops, we modify the call to work around this this [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/643ae878d7cc5204aa096b9f9946e5ccac0aea25/dask/dataframe/core.py#L2554)\r\n\r\nThis unwanted alignment has come up in a few places recently https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2809, https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/2807. I wonder if it's worthwhile to let the caller specify which elements of `*args` should go through `_maybe_from_pandas` and `_maybe_align_partitions`.",
