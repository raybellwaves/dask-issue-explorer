But with dask, you might not want to evaluate these checks eagerly, because doing so might very expensive. Instead, we could have errors raised only when I finally run `dask.compute()`.\n\nWe might allow writing something like:\n\n```\nda.assert_((x > 0).all(), ValueError, 'x must be positive')\n```\n\nThe tricky part would be figuring out how to insert an assert statement into the task dependency graph without making a mess of global state.\n",
