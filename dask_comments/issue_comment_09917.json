        "body": "Good catch @charlesbluca. Looking briefly into the source for api vs non-api pages, it appears \r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"_static/images/favicon.svg\"/>\r\n    <link rel=\"index\" title=\"Index\" href=\"genindex.html\" />\r\n    <link rel=\"search\" title=\"Search\" href=\"search.html\" />\r\n```\r\n in their HTML source, while api pages have \r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"_static/images/favicon.svg\"/>\r\n    <link rel=\"index\" title=\"Index\" href=\"../genindex.html\" />\r\n    <link rel=\"search\" title=\"Search\" href=\"../search.html\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in page pages, all relative links start with `../` which I think makes sense because api pages are one level down inside a `generated/` directory. However, it looks like the favicon link didn't get a `../` added, hence why it's not getting rendered. Though I'm not sure why `../` isn't getting added. \r\n\r\ncc @choldgraf does this look familiar to you at all? ",

It looks like we made that pin to avoid some of the breaking changes you mentioned. \r\n\r\nFWIW I locally installed the latest `sphinx-book-theme=0.3.3` release and saw the same issue (i.e. no `../` leading the favicon link).
