Confusingly this only happens when the dataframe that it's merged with (in this case `a`) has a partition of 1. It works fine when both dataframes have more than 1 partition. Dask dataframe made up of pandas dataframe doesn't seem to have this issue.\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2023.11.0\r\n- Python version: 3.11.6\r\n- Operating System: Linux\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): conda\r\n",
