See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:\r\n\r\n- Craft Minimal Bug Reports http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports\r\n- Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nBug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the issue**:\r\n\r\nEmulating outerindexing via `vindex` + `np.ix_` appears to be much slower and more memory intensive (prohibitively so for very large arrays where for an 1,000,000x1,000,000 array, it tried allocating 1.5TB of memory) than twice indexing.   I know this is basically stated in the docs, but maybe there is something to be done here? If not, feel free to close.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n%load_ext memory_profiler\r\n\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport scipy as sp\r\n\r\nchunksize = 100\r\nsize = 10_000\r\nn_points = 5000\r\n\r\nX = da.random.poisson(15, (size, size), chunks = (chunksize, chunksize))\r\n\r\nindex_0 = np.random.randint(0, X.shape[0], n_points)\r\nindex_0.sort()\r\nindex_1 = np.random.randint(0, X.shape[1], n_points)\r\nindex_1.sort()\r\n\r\nprint('vindex timing:')\r\n%timeit X.vindex[np.ix_(index_0, index_1)].compute()\r\nprint('vindex memory usage:')\r\n%memit X.vindex[np.ix_(index_0, index_1)]\r\nprint('double-index timing:')\r\n%timeit X[index_0, :][:, index_1].compute()\r\nprint('double-index memory usage:')\r\n%memit X[index_0, :][:, index_1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2024.3.1\r\n- Python version: 3.12\r\n- Operating System: mac\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): pip\r\n",
