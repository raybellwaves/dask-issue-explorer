Some other out of scope, but also useful things that could be done:\r\n\r\n- making sure that all `config.get`/`set` calls are using an existing / consistent config option; in looking through the codebase, I noticed [some typos](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/4e5dfe7463028a39a90e026c7fb9220969093ab3/dask/dataframe/tests/test_shuffle.py#L301) when setting config options, and others that are referred to by different names (i.e. `array.slicing.split-large-chunks` vs `array.slicing.split_large_chunks`)\r\n- Adding a simple Python test (or, if mandatory, CI job) to check that if a new config option is added, it is referenced in the schema\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx\r\n- [ ] Tests added / passed\r\n- [ ] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
