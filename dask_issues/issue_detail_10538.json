    "body": "Hi Guys. I have built a python quantitive investment algorithm in python (mostly cupy). It is quite long and complex, therefore, when even though it is fully vectorized, I need to use for loops to avoid memory issues. Im currently adapting this algorithm to work with dask, so that I can scale up without needing for loops to handle memory issues. Im working with a distributed scheduler and dask-cuda on colab. My issue is that given the complexity of the algorithm, I need it to run in a very specific order to avoid memory overflow. Im having difficulties because of the way Dask's task graph is built (seems like a black box, I don't know what order of operations is being made and why, given that the graph is too big to be seen). I need to have 100% control of how/order the operations/tasks are done, so that I can replicate exactly the way my loops in pure python/cupy were being executed, which had no memory issues. I'm using mostly dask arrays for this code.",
