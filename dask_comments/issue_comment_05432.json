I've since got it to the state above with one of my Default VPCs by doing the following:\r\n\r\n* create a Private subnet in the default VPC\r\n* create a NAT Gateway in one of the public subnets\r\n* create a Route table with a route to `0.0.0.0/0` via the NAT Gateway\r\n* associate the Private subnet above to the Route table above\r\n\r\nAgain, launch the notebook instance into the Private subnet. One extra detail I didn't mention previously, I disabled internet access via SageMaker in the notebook networking config.  This makes it so that access to the internet is provided via the VPC.",

(*Also possible via a bastion host as explained in the link above*)\r\n\r\nAny problems/errors let me know and i'll update!\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\n#### 0. Register for a free account at https://ngrok.com/ and get your authentication token\r\n\r\n#### 1. (On Sagemaker) Setup Ngrok\r\n```\r\n# Download latest ngrok\r\ncurl https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip > ngrok.zip\r\n# Unzip\r\nunzip ngrok.zip\r\n# Add your ngrok authentication key (found here -> https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup)\r\n./ngrok authtoken <ADD-YOUR-AUTH-KEY-HERE>\r\n```\r\n#### 2. (On local machine) Find and copy your local machine's public ssh key.\r\nIn windows this is found in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Copy the entire string. It should look something like:\r\n```\r\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2....\r\n.....\r\n....= david@MY-LAPTOP-NAME\r\n```\r\n#### 3. (On Sagemaker) Add this SSH key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Use your favourite terminal editor for this (e.g. vim/nano)\r\n\r\n#### 4. (On Sagemaker) Run the ngrok TCP service\r\n```\r\n./ngrok tcp 22\r\n```\r\nIf successful, you should see something like this\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2926574/86540377-ac4d3b00-befc-11ea-9b79-38faa6b178d5.png)\r\n\r\nGrab the host (red) and port (green).\r\n\r\n#### 5. (On Sagemaker) Create a notebook, start your dask client and grab the dashboard port (default=8787)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2926574/86540416-1534b300-befd-11ea-8ecd-a9b32c6e026b.png)\r\n\r\n#### 6. (On local machine) Connect via SSH Tunnel\r\nUsing the host and port obtained in step 4. and the dashboard port in step 5.\r\n```\r\nssh -p <PORT> ec2-user@<HOST> -L <DASHBOARD-PORT>:localhost:8787\r\n# e.g. ssh -p 13171 ec2-user@0.tcp.ngrok.io -L 8787:localhost:8787\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 7. Access the dask dashboard now available in your localhost\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2926574/86540485-ac9a0600-befd-11ea-8e68-2ea04102a03a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
