    "body": "In the process of applying some operations on Dask Arrays, chunk sizes can become a bit heterogeneous. However storage applications tend to prefer more homogeneous chunk sizes. While it is possible to the store a Dask Array to a storage format with different chunk sizes, this typically comes at a penalty of needing locking. Certainly one can rechunk the Dask Array manually. However it would be nice to have a method for Dask Arrays, which has some better ideas as to what sort of rechunking will come with low penalty. This method can then determine some reasonable homogeneous chunk size and rechunk the Dask Array using them.",
