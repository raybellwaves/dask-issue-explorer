Thanks for sharing @mrocklin.\r\n\r\n@wence- brings up a fair point about folks who care a lot about data privacy might still be hesitant to use such a utility. That said, many times folks can't share their data just because it's in a private location  (e.g. a private S3 bucket) but would okay sharing information like dtypes, size of dataset, etc. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a neat utility, should someone have bandwidth to work on it ",
