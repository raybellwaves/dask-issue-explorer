        "body": "Interesting idea. How does dask's config currently handle dictionary values? Looking at the donfig docs (which I ported from dask) https://donfig.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html it looks like there is no distinction between a value that is a dictionary and sub-config entries.\r\n\r\n`<brainstorm>`\r\nThis would probably be easiest to implement with donfig and then make dask use donfig. If the donfig main `Config` object was a `dict` (or Mapping) subclass then it could just work. But this also scares me. You might have to add some special key to the config dictionaries (`\"_config\": True`) to know that they are configs and not dicts or maybe it is OK if they are not plain dicts?\r\n\r\nI think there may be too many cases where dictionaries are treated as values and as configs. If that works for every piece of code interacting with it then :man_shrugging: maybe it's ok.\r\n`</brainstorm>`",
