This is particularly confusing as it can be easy to trigger these (potentially large) computations when using in an `if`-statement. \r\n\r\nI'm curious to see how much of our test suite fails when we don't allow this type of implicit compute. \r\n\r\nAlso cc @jakirkham who has previously commented on this behavior https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/2958#issuecomment-349061303 and may have thoughts on this topic \r\n\r\n",
