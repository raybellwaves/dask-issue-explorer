We can maybe add a docstring with a note here that says `corrceof` doesn't support `sparse` arrays:\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/5fbda77cfc5bc1b8f1453a2dbb034b048fc10726/dask/array/routines.py#L1561-L1569\r\n\r\n>  Or should functions that aren't implemented for sparse arrays in numpy still work with sparse arrays in dask?\r\n\r\nGenerally, I don't think so, becauase Dask Array tries to match NumPy. One exception could be if there is an implementation in the [`sparse` API](https://sparse.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/sparse.html). :)",
