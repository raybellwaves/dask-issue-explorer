    "body": "Dask currently supports YAML config files at a number of _global_ paths: https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/configuration.html#yaml-files. However, it can be useful to set configuration per-project.\r\n\r\nYou can currently do this by creating a YAML file in your repo (say `dask.yaml`) and setting `DASK_CONFIG=dask.yaml`. But then you need to remember to set the environment variable all the time, or use dotenv or something.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Dask would also also search for a `dask.yaml` file (name up for debate) in the current directory, and have it take precedence over the other layers of config. Possibly it could also traverse up from the current directory until it found a `dask.yaml` file.",
