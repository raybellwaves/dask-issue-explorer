    "body": "There have been some issues coming up with how we handle `meta`. I think they boil down to users needing a way to control the meta on their dask.dataframe objects. \r\n\r\n1. add public methods for setting/getting meta.\r\n2. add meta as a kwarg on all functions so people can optionally specify what their output looks like\r\n3. preserve as much info as possible on meta (things like setting meta to a subset of the data on read).\r\n4. improve error messages so that issues that come up are less cryptic, this will often look like suggesting that users pass meta in as a kwarg. \r\n\r\nThis idea is kind of related to https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8435",
