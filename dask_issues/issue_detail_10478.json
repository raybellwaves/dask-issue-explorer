    "body": "While investigating benchmark results in dask-expr, @phofl noticed that predicate pushdown was giving us surprisingly bad performance in some cases. Although defining `filters` is clearly beneficial when we can drop entire row-groups from the dataset, the row-wise filtering step that pyarrow applies at read time is much less beneficial. In fact, it is typically faster to delay the row-wise filtering step until just **after** IO is complete (either with pandas or pyarrow).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the minimal possible change needed to delay the row-wise filtering step until just after IO. Note that row-groups and hive-partitions will already have been filtered before the modified function is executed. Therefore, these changes do **not** mean that we will **need** data to be in memory for filtering.",
