    "body": "I would like to be able to create a Dask array of the same shape as another Dask array of unknown length and with contents that are randomized.\r\nFor example I have an array like this\r\n`dask.array<getitem, shape=(nan,), dtype=float64, chunksize=(nan,), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>`\r\nand I want a Dask array of the same shape, without computing chunk sizes. The contents of the new array are randomized and I can, for example, multiply it with my original array.\r\n\r\nI know PyTorch has a function like this (`torch.randn_like`) but I could not find such a thing in Dask. It would be especially useful in Dask because of the unknown lengths in Dask. I also think the function should be able to use or be part of the random number generator API (which is not true for PyTorch).",
