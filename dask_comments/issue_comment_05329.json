I'd like to be able to rewrite a `__array_function__` or `__array_ufunc__` so that it returns `NotImplemented` if the other object is higher in the type hierarchy.\r\n\r\nRight now, `pint` maintains a list of types that are higher in the hierarchy. `xarray` seems to be doing the same for its implementation of `__array_ufunc__`, except that it lists the types lower in the hierarchy. These explicit lists have the obvious disadvantage that for every new type the library has to be updated.\r\n\r\nApologies if this has been discussed elsewhere, I could not find anything relevant that answered my question.",

It would be great to have some clearer guidance (or even an \"Informational NEP\" like that mentioned by @shoyer in https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/issues/845#issuecomment-525498066).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, as far as I'm aware, from an implementation point-of-view, right now the hierarchy described above is currently held-up/broken by:\r\n- https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/4583\r\n- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15200\r\n\r\nI've been wanting to help with these, but I've unfortunately not had the time these past several months, and I'm really not sure how the coming days and weeks are going to go either.",
