    "body": "When working with some `ddf`s recently containing integer columns, I noticed a couple issues when slicing column `0`, which is \"falsy\" - depending on the operation, sometimes I would get the wrong column output (eg: `.groupby(...)[0].agg(...)` would return a different column, _if_ `0` wasn't the first) or get a dataframe back instead of a series. These were mostly caused by `if self._slice` checks which should be `if self._slice is None` checks.\r\n\r\nWhile looking into this, I also discovered issues with `ddf.groupby(scalar_value).cov()` (`'int' object is not iterable`). I think this is mostly isolated to `.cov`, but there's a lot of other logic checking or converting `self.by` to a list elsewhere, so harder to say.\r\n\r\nThe added tests fail when run without the changes, but aren't particularly clear/tidy - any suggestions on a better way (or an existing test)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
