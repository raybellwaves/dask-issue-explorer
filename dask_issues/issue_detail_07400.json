While I do have this reproducible test, and found some relevant pandas code, I'm not sure why it's even worse when interacting with the dask multiprocess scheduler.\r\n\r\nChecks two issues:\r\n  1. Is the `groupby().apply`'d function called twice, but with a missing column on the second call?\r\n  2. Is a TypeError (and only a TypeError) thrown from the first call swallowed and hidden\r\n\r\nTypeErrors are handled differently due to this code in pandas:\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v1.3.0.dev0/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py#L892-L905\r\n",
