    "body": "Recently we added the ability to batch submissions with the local scheduler [using `chunksize`]( https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a31c0fc72e1cc59b8b0254965824abb0718c5f56/dask/local.py#L420 ) as users have voiced interest ( https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/6220#issuecomment-648878068 ). Mostly this is unused (so a no-op) with [the exception of the `multiprocessing` case where we do some batching]( https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a31c0fc72e1cc59b8b0254965824abb0718c5f56/dask/multiprocessing.py#L178 ) to amortize the cost of process spin up. It's also not that visible in the documentation or elsewhere. That said, we might want to share this more broadly.\r\n\r\nOne question that comes up with this is whether we like the parameter name, `chunksize` (taken from `concurrent.futures` and used elsewhere ( https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/3650 )) or if that's confusing and we want to use something else like `batchsize`. Another question is this sits at the top-level config (similar to other things like [`pool` and `num_workers`]( https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a31c0fc72e1cc59b8b0254965824abb0718c5f56/dask/multiprocessing.py#L179-L180 )), is that where we want this? Lastly is this parameter useful outside the local scheduler (like would Distributed want to use this)\r\n\r\n",
