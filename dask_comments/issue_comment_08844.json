        "body": "@jacobjma Thanks for opening this issue! I'm able to reproduce this, and it does seem like a bug. \r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n* `axes = [1]`/`axis=1` seems to be giving the correct result (but it's semantically wrong?)\r\n* interestingly, using `chunks=(1,5)` produces the correct result with your original code\r\n\r\nPotential ideas:\r\n* this is a bug in `apply_gufunc`\r\n* if it isn't a bug, we maybe need a better error message (rather than creating the 25-element output in this example)\r\n* either way, it's worth updating the docs to explain these parameters better :)\r\n\r\n> When I briefly looked over the source code, I see that the arrays are very deliberately transposed\r\n\r\nThanks for noting! It does seem relevant. Here's a link for future reference: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/bc43d692e8f5fc55e6d81c91053598bd89f79267/dask/array/gufunc.py#L383-L391",
