This wouldn't and so might surprise users.  \r\n\r\nAs an alternative, there has been some effort to make things like `df = df.repartition(bytes='1 GB')` work.  This also has the same concern that it forces the computation of df (there is no way to see how big partitions are otherwise), but at least it's only one such case that is more generally useful, rather than having many small utility functions, some of which do or do not trigger computation.",

But, I wonder if users who want to actively remove empty partitions may be more aware of the implications. Perhaps a common moment that a user notices empty partitions is while debugging downstream failures (extrapolating, perhaps wrongly, from myself). In that case, an API method to achieve this (perhaps with good documentation or a warning) would be appealing.",
