If you have a use case then raise an issue. Also, users interested in this should take a look at vindex.\r\n\r\nI believe I have a use case for this feature. Commonly in types of spectral analysis we have a cube in the form of a 3D array i.e. x,y,z = space,space,spectrum\r\n\r\nIn numpy it is easy to keep track of value of the spectral index values with a 1D array of the same length as the z axis (the same is true of the other axes, and is probably generalisable to N-dimensions).\r\n\r\nHere's a basic example of finding the value along the spectral axis that corresponds to the maximum in the spectrum:\r\n```python\r\n# 10x10 image with a depth of 100\r\nnx,ny,nz = 10, 10, 100\r\ncube_arr = np.random.normal(size=[nz,ny,nx])\r\n# Spectral axis goes from 0 to 10 over the 100 pixels\r\nspectrum = np.linspace(0,10,nz)\r\n# Find the pixels corresponding to max\r\ncube_max_idx = np.argmax(cube_arr, axis=0)\r\n# Get the values of the spectrum at the max - 2D array \r\nmax_vals = spectrum[cube_max_idx]\r\n```\r\nThe equivalent in dask.array would be:\r\n```python\r\n# 10x10 image with a depth of 100 - Obviously we would want to go bigger with Dask!\r\nnx,ny,nz = 10, 10, 100\r\ncube_arr = da.random.random([nz,ny,nx])\r\n# Spectral axis goes from 0 to 10 over the 100 pixels\r\nspectrum = da.linspace(0,10,nz)\r\n# Find the pixels corresponding to max\r\ncube_max_idx = da.argmax(cube_arr, axis=0)\r\n# Get the values of the spectrum at the max\r\nmax_vals = spectrum[cube_max_idx]\r\n```\r\nWhich currently raises\r\n```\r\nNotImplementedError: Slicing with dask.array of ints only permitted when the indexer has zero or one dimensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nHappy to provide more details if that helps. Thanks! ",
