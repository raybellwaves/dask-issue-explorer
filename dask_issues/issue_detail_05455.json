    "body": "We may want to avoid fusing literals in task graphs.  \r\n\r\nNow that many computations are run through the distributed scheduler, it may be wise to avoid fusing literal values that are placed into task graphs.  The communication machinery is better able to handle these objects if they are on their own, rather than deep within a complex task.  For example for numpy arrays we're able to serialize and compress these much more effectively.  For HDF5 datasets we're actually able to serialize them, while if we fuse them into a task then we have to use cloudpickle, which ends up failing.\r\n\r\ncc @eriknw in case you both have time and if this is easy.",
