    "body": "Currently when people convert a pandas dataframe into a dask dataframe they use the from_pandas function\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(...)\r\nddf = dd.from_pandas(df, npartitions=10)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient to make the `npartitions=` choice for them\r\n\r\n```python\r\nddf = dd.from_pandas(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could do this by looking at `dask.sizeof.sizeof(df)` to get an estiamte of the size of the dataframe, and then dividing that number by some ideal chunk size (perhaps `128 MiB` to start out with).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a step towards this, we might support a string input to the `chunksize=` keyword\r\n\r\n```python\r\nddf = dd.from_pandas(df, chunksize=\"128 MiB\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would use the sizeof trick above, and then assign npartitions approrpiately.\r\n\r\nNote that this is somewhat different than the current use of chunksize, which refers to number of rows",
