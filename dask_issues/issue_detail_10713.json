    "body": "Instead of a nested object (e.g. `dict` or `list`) I get a string, which although looks slightly like JSON, isn't valid for `json.loads` (it's probably result of calling `str(...)` on some object).\r\nUnfortunately, many real-life parquet files use nested objects for some columns. One such toy example is public blockchain data: https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-digital-assets-on-aws/blob/main/analytics/consumer/schema/btc.md#table-transactions (`transactions.inputs` is an array of dicts)\r\n\r\nFor example Spark supports such nested objects: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29948789/how-to-parse-nested-json-objects-in-spark-sql, Google BigQuery as well",
