        "body": "@Reggieharden looks like you are deploying workers with only 0.93GiB of memory. This is very little considering that the interpreter and a couple of default libs (e.g. pandas, dask, sqlalchemy) already take up more than 100MiB and it's not unheard of having the interpreter + imports use much more. \r\n`read_sql_table` is, by default, **attempting** to fetch chunks in size of 256MiB but this depends on your data, the database, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, with a say 200MiB interpreter overhead, a ~300MiB chunk you are already at almost 55% of memory utilization. We're already starting to spill to disk at a 60% threshold (see https://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/worker-memory.html#thresholds-configuration) so I recommend to increase your worker sizes a bit and see if this issue persists. Also, please ensure that you are using the latest version of dask since memory utilization has improved considerably over the last couple of months.\r\n\r\nIf you need help figuring out how to better deploy your K8s cluster, I recommend opening a topic in https://dask.discourse.group/c/deploying-dask/9 We try answering usage related questions in discourse and keep the issue tracker open for bugs, feature requests, etc.\r\n\r\n@ChenhanXmu I recommend to move to discourse as well and describe the problem you're seeing or open a new ticket with your problem with more information.",
