        "body": "Thanks for writing up the proposal @bielefem .  I enjoyed reading it.  I think that such a project would be useful.  I might encourage you to try basing it off of Dask's [concurrent.futures API](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/futures.html) which should be flexible enough to support the operations you need.  \r\n\r\nI noticed that you were using the Dask namespace in the proposal, which suggests that you were proposing that this be implemented *within* dask.  I suspect that this would be difficult to do while still supporting all of the other use cases of Dask today and keeping the codebase simple enough to be cheaply maintained.  However, I think that this would make an excellent external package.  Indeed, this is how most development around Dask happens today, including newer scheduler work.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to implement something like this then please stay connected.  We'd love to hear how it goes!",
