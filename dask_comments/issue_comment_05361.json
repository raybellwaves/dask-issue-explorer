Most of the filesystems adhere to the s3 block api have a way to stage a file and perform the commit of a file at a different place than its creation location.\r\n\r\nOne key part is that a write for a dataset typically targets a directory for where to place output files.  Dask needs an additional component similar to the hadoop OutputCommitter to ensure that these commits of files happen cleanly.  \r\n\r\nThis component obviously should commit files, but additionally can clean up directories when datasets are overwritten or complaining if there are already files present in the output path.\r\n",
