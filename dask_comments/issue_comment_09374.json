        "body": "Thanks for opening this @TomNicholas! I have a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. The mypy failure definitely feels like a hypothesis issue. It seems like it would not be too hard to pass the type though the decorator though (I'm looking at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65621789/mypy-untyped-decorator-makes-function-my-method-untyped) so they would likely welcome that change upstream.\r\n2. I am not convinced that this belongs in the dask/array part of the codebase. This is something the people would only use in  tests right so probably it should like in dask/array/tests/strategies.py\r\n3. I don't have an opinion on whether to expose `max_num_chunks` or `max_chunk_length`. You could allow them both and error if they are both specified. Regardless of that choice these methods should be private at least to start.\r\n4. Is this something that you are interested in maintaining? If so then great - I feel fine merging it into Dask if we can just ping you if something breaks :)",

        "body": "Thanks for your comments @jsignell !\r\n\r\n> The mypy failure definitely feels like a hypothesis issue.\r\n\r\nI noticed there are recent changes to the code for that decorator in hypothesis so it might be that requiring a more recent version would fix this typing error? Looks like [this PR](https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/3396) was intended to make typing work with `@st.composite`.\r\n\r\n> I am not convinced that this belongs in the `dask/array` part of the codebase. This is something the people would only use in tests right so probably it should like in `dask/array/tests/strategies.py`\r\n\r\nThis depends on whether you think the `tests` namespace should be entirely a private library internal or not (I do). In xarray at least (and in numpy) we use `tests` to refer to internal checks checks that are run by pytest, and `testing` to refer to any test-related public API that someone else might want to import. So for example `xarray.tests` imports `assert_equal` from `xarray.testing`. (And yes we have an `xarray/tests/test_testing.py` file :grin:) However if dask has a different policy then I'm happy to defer, I just think this separation is neat.\r\n\r\n> I don't have an opinion on whether to expose `max_num_chunks` or `max_chunk_length`\r\n\r\nThis is really an intuition question for dask devs about which they think is more important for finding bugs. `max_num_chunks` would create uniform-length chunks by default (which we might want the strategy to arbitrarily deviate a bit from). `max_chunk_length` would create completely non-uniform chunks, but that might be overkill for finding bugs and/or mean an inefficient strategy.\r\n\r\n> You could allow them both and error if they are both specified. \r\n\r\nI kind of don't really want to do that because they imply different strategies implementations under the hood, so allowing both is twice as much work :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\n> Regardless of that choice these methods should be private at least to start.\r\n>\r\n> Is this something that you are interested in maintaining? If so then great - I feel fine merging it into Dask if we can just ping you if something breaks :)\r\n\r\nI'm putting these here so that I can import them in xarray (/xGCM/xhistogram...)! So I am happy to maintain them, but I also want the `chunks` strategy to be public so that I'm not relying on private API.",
