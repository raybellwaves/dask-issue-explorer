    "body": "With dask array and dask dataframe I find myself often wanting to store in-memory data in some other format than numpy arrays or pandas dataframes.\r\n\r\nTwo examples:\r\n\r\n1.  With low-entropy data or low-bitcount data I want to store numpy arrays as Zarr arrays in memory\r\n2.  With text data in Pandas I want to store Pandas dataframes as Arrow tables (here is a [notebook](https://gist.github.com/e0e3b4a468c17160c8ae6dc6b4bac651) (cc @wesm if you're interested))\r\n\r\nThere are two ways that we can do this:\r\n\r\n1.  We can have Dask workers transform data by default when they start experiencing memory pressure.  This is the topic of https://github.com/dask/distributed/issues/3656\r\n2.  We can have users opt-in to an alternative format when persisting their data, maybe something like the following:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    df = df.persist(format=\"arrow\")\r\n    x = x.persist(format=\"zarr\", format_options={\"compressor\": \"blosc\"})\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nBoth of these seem useful sometimes, but also open us up to confusion in the future.",
