This expression layer doesn't do anything, in only holds a single opaque type, but it demonstrates the ease/pain with which we could introduce a new abstraction and slowly phase out immediate metadata construction.\r\n\r\nMost of the pain here was about being careful with attribute assignment / properties / getters and setters.  I didn't bother with all of this so about half of the test suite fails.  This is enough though, I think, to show a path.\r\n\r\nThis is part of an ongoing conversation with @jrbourbeau @fjetter @rjzamora ",
