Perhaps we should start validating the config `set`/`get` operations against the schema.\r\n\r\n> others that are referred to by different names (i.e. array.slicing.split-large-chunks vs array.slicing.split_large_chunks\r\n\r\nYep, the dask config [normalizes](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/configuration.html#access-configuration) underscores to dashes, so these two should be equivalent.",
