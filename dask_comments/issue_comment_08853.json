        "body": "Hi @karolzlot, welcome to Dask, thanks for opening this issue! I'm not able to reproduce this (I'm on a macOS system, but I matched your Python and Dask versions). Could you please share more information about the extensions you're using and the `Python Language Server` (I'm assuming it's Pylance, but I can't reproduce using Jedi either). It may be a Windows thing?\r\n\r\nIt also seems like this is more of a usage question than a bug report or feature request. We encourage people with such questions to ask them at the [Dask Discourse](https://dask.discourse.group/). Would you mind opening a discussion topic about this over there? If you do so, feel free to close this issue and we will continue the conversation on discourse!",

        "body": "> Hi @karolzlot, welcome to Dask, thanks for opening this issue! I'm not able to reproduce this (I'm on a macOS system, but I matched your Python and Dask versions). Could you please share more information about the extensions you're using and the `Python Language Server` (I'm assuming it's Pylance, but I can't reproduce using Jedi either). It may be a Windows thing?\r\n> \r\n> It also seems like this is more of a usage question than a bug report or feature request. We encourage people with such questions to ask them at the [Dask Discourse](https://dask.discourse.group/). Would you mind opening a discussion topic about this over there? If you do so, feel free to close this issue and we will continue the conversation on discourse!\r\n\r\nTry using vscode:\r\nextensions: Pylance (Microsoft), Mypi Type Checker (Microsoft)\r\nconfig: Type Checking Mode: strict\r\n\r\n![extensions](https://i.ibb.co/nsxrGGq/extensions.png)\r\n![config](https://i.ibb.co/861Mzgt/config.png)",
