    "body": "I was trying to specify chunk size for the output zarr when writing from a dask array: \r\n```python\r\n# cc_img is a dask array\r\ncc_img.to_zarr(ccd_zarr_path,\r\n               component=f\"0/{current_pyr_lvl}\",\r\n               overwrite=True,\r\n               compressor=compressor,\r\n               chunks=(1,1,1,256,256)\r\n               )\r\n``` \r\n`cc_img`'s chunks were `(1,1,3,256,256)`\r\n\r\nI started getting a hard error, that `zarr.create` gets multiple instances of `chunks` keyword. \r\n\r\nThis is easily fixeable by changing expression `chunks = [c[0] for c in arr.chunks]` to `chunks = [c[0] for c in arr.chunks] if 'chunks' not in kwargs.keys() else kwargs.pop('chunks')` [on line 3714](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/da256320ef0167992f7183c3a275d092f5727f62/dask/array/core.py#L3714C22-L3714C22). \r\n\r\nOverall, `da.to_zarr()` needs a way to resolve this, as right now it implies the chunks' shape from an input array ",
