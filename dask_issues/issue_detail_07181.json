    "body": "In PR ( https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7162 ), we needed to add a `.compute(scheduler=\"sync\")` call in one case (see below). While this seems ok for the cases where we needed it (concrete arrays, scalars, and Python objects). There's the potential this could be used on other objects (like Dask Arrays) where we would not want to use this. It would be good to figure out another way to solve this problem (if possible) that does not rely on the usage of `compute`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/996b50666ad197da2d30da415ce1790e3809aad4/dask/array/utils.py#L404\r\n\r\ncc @pentschev @jrbourbeau",
