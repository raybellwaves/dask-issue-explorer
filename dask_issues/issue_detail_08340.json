    "body": "Dask Arrays mostly support [NEP-18](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0018-array-function-protocol.html) dispatching via `__array_function__`, meaning you can call NumPy functions like `np.where` on dask Arrays, and it'll return dask arrays (dispatching to `dask.array.where` internally).\r\n\r\nWe should do the same for DataFrames. In the same way that `np.where` and other functions work on pandas DataFrames, they should also work equivalently on dask DataFrames. In practice, I think most NumPy functions on pandas DataFrames return NumPy arrays, so our implementation should probably return dask Arrays to be consistent. But in any case, the input shouldn't be computed.\r\n\r\nNote that we do already support `__array_ufunc__` on DataFrame; the next step would be to also support `__array_function__`.\r\n\r\nFor users transitioning pandas code to dask that involves calling NumPy on DataFrames, this could be helpful.\r\n\r\ncc @pentschev @jsignell ",
