        "body": "Hello @mrocklin. Following my work on the docs and the time I've spent tinkering with Dask, I'm feeling more confident in navigating the codebase to look into something like this. The problem is easy to understand, but I may ask a question about the implementation as I get into It. \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to assign if you feels that's appropriate. Regardless, I'll just crack on with it. \r\n\r\nEDIT: worth noting I wonder if \"suffering\" the whole pass of large CSVs should be an option/argument selected by the user, depending on how desirable a consistent original index will be for them",
