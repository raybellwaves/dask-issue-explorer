    "body": "Hi, sorry to be asking here instead of SO but I am not sure if someone is actively looking at SO since I haven't received any response yet.\r\n\r\nI am facing an issue relative to splitting my data based on a specific column. I haven't figured out what is the proposed way of splitting your data while honouring a group based on column so I invoked `train_test_split` on the `.unique()` of a column and then I want to use the results to filter my original dataframe using `Series.isin`. the problem is that is in doesn't work on lazily results. This mean that in order to compute the input to isin the whole graph that I haven't computed so far will need to be calculated. I am wondering am I understanding this correctly? does that mean that at this point my pipeline will need to execute the whole graph to get to the unique list and then in the end of my pipeline where I export data to disk the whole graph will be computed again? Does dask have a way to no repeat the computations that overlap with the computations needed for the unique?\r\n\r\nAgain sorry for posting here, any help is very appreciated :) ",
