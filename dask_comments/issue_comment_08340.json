To be equivalent, we'd simply like them to turn into dask Arrays instead :)",

The ways in which they mismatch may cause difficult to debug errors if we go down this path\n\nIdeally we would add functions we want to be dispatchable to the Data API and leverage that here. This has come up in other places we (the Dask Community) have had this discussion before ( https://github.com/data-apis/dataframe-api/issues/50 )\n\ncc @rgommers @jorisvandenbossche (for vis; feel free to copy others :)",
