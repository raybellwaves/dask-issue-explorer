        "body": "> I recalled that the `gdf_hash` function was originally created for @sklam to do much the same as what @quasiben is doing for dask-cudf's Join: Compute the hash of a set of rows, do the modulo, and then repartition based on the mapping of hash values to partition number.\r\n> \r\n> I don't recall exact numbers, but in @sklam's original implementation the \"shuffle\" was still a signifcant portion of the runtime: 1/3 to 1/2 of the total Join time. After transitioning to use `partition_by_hash`, the shuffle was a trivial portion of the runtime.\r\n\r\nI believe this was before we had an optimized gather implementation and it was getting bottlenecked in using Numba kernels, but I could be mistaken.",
