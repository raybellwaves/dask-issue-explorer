Currently, rolling `var` and `std` are computed using `ddof=1` regardless of what the user specifies. E.g, if the user wants to set `ddof=2`, these rolling methods will ignore this and incorrectly compute with `ddof=1`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
