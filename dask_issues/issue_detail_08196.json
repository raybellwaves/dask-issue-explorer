    "body": "As discussed in #8193, now that Dask's `sort_values` has null handling, it might be worthwhile refactoring `set_partitions_pre` to remove the `try..except` block there. Now the function does the following:\r\n\r\n- Calls `searchsorted` on only the non-null elements of `divisions` and `s` (avoiding the failure caused when `divisions` and `s` contain strings)\r\n- Uses item assignment to place the null elements of `s` in the correct partition based on `na_position`\r\n- Uses item assignment to place any elements of `s` incorrectly sorted by `searchsorted` into the correct partition based on `ascending`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as suggested by @rjzamora there might be less overhead by initializing our `partitions` array with `np.zeros` rather than `np.empty`.\r\n\r\nAfter the cuDF breakage that resulted from #8167, I would prefer merging this after we have some additional dask-cuDF testing for `set_index`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Closes #xxxx\r\n- [ ] Tests added / passed\r\n- [ ] Passes `black dask` / `flake8 dask` / `isort dask`\r\n",
