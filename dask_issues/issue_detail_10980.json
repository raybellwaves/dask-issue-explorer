See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:\r\n\r\n- Craft Minimal Bug Reports http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports\r\n- Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nBug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the issue**:\r\nComputing a masked version of a sparse array throws an error on `compute`.  I am aware than sparse support may not be official but figured I'd report anyway.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom scipy import sparse\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\n\r\nX = sparse.random(10_000, 1_000, format=\"csr\", density=0.1)\r\nX_dask = da.from_array(X)\r\nX_dask[X_dask > 0].compute()\r\nX_dask[X_dask > 0] = 1000\r\nX_dask.compute()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\nI am happy to help with this (and other things we are loosely aware of surrounding sparse arrays) if you would accept a PR or investigation at least.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2024.2.1\r\n- Python version:  3.9.18\r\n- Operating System: Mac\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): `pip`\r\n",
