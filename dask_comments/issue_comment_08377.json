        "body": "Thanks for writing this up! \r\n\r\nJust for context, the How To... section is a new idea that is meant to expand over time and contain lots of little snippets explaining how to do different things. I moved the deployment docs into there (this might have been the wrong idea and we can undo it if we need) to populate the folder, but it is meant to grow to include lots of short \"recipes\".\r\n\r\nWe have been talking about how to make the distributed bits more discoverable and raising them up in the hierarchy. In particular we are planning to expand scheduling and add a new section about the dashboard specifically. \r\n\r\nWith regards to making it easier to learn how to load data. I think that should live in examples as well as in \"how-to\". It is probably already in both, so maybe it's just a matter of pointing to those from a lot of places? Or were you thinking it should be a new top level section in getting started?",
