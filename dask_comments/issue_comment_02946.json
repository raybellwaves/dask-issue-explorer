        "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nWe often borrow NumPy's documentation for these functions. This is certainly one of the downsides of doing that.\r\n\r\nSo that checklist is basically something I threw together last night. Wouldn't give it too much credence yet. It definitely does not take into account full functionality being supported. Just whether the function is there and works on some basic inputs. If you have some suggestions on how the checklist could be clarified for issues like this, would be open to hearing them.\r\n\r\nHmm... A naive solution would be to slice out sections of the array and `repeat` them independently. Though that could result in a lot of overhead for large arrays. A better solution would probably be to wrap up this call to `repeat` with [`apply_along_axis`]( http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.apply_along_axis ). However we would need to make some tweaks to `apply_along_axis` for this to work. Also this assumes that a 1-D array with length equal to the dimension being repeated in question can comfortably fit in memory. ",

        "body": "Hi @jakirkham Thanks for the quick response.\r\n\r\nThe check list is not a problem - just ran across it when I searched `repeat` in the open tickets list to make sure a ticket similar to this was already open. It's a shame that markdown does't half the half checked status `[-]` that might have been a nice way to indicate some missing functionality well keeping the list concise as it is now.  \r\n\r\nWe've actually found a way round this for now that just removes some accuracy in favour of getting it to fit into memory. So it's not as hard requirement for us at the moment as I thought it was going to be on opening the ticket - so don't feel any obligation to go out your way to prioritise this over anything else you are working on.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work on dask.\r\n",

Plus it would avoid some issues I've learned about large checks lists in GitHub issues. :)\r\n\r\nI see. Well I expect the fix to `apply_along_axis` will be a one liner TBH. So definitely doable. Can point you to the line if you would like to do a simple PR. ;) Sounds like the data regime you are working in would be sufficiently satisfied with using `apply_along_axis` for many things (including this case).",
