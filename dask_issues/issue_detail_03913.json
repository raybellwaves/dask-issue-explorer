    "body": "This may be misdirected, but wanted to provide feedback on the new centralized config system. I recently implemented the latest version of dask and distributed. After doing so, I typed `import distributed` and got:\r\n```\r\nyaml.parser.ParserError: expected '<document start>', but found '<scalar>'\r\n  in \"<unicode string>\", line 2, column 1:\r\n    keys=root\r\n    ^\r\n```\r\nI usually interpret these sorts of errors as some stale version of a dependency. I spent a while trying to confirm that dependencies were installed correctly.\r\nIn the end, I was caught because the new centralized config file parser was picking up some defunct, ill-defined yaml file with this:\r\n```\r\n[loggers]\r\nkeys=root\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was not at all clear from the error I got initially. I don't see any other reports like this, so maybe mine is a corner case. If not, then dask may want to add a check for valid yaml files before it tries to parse them.",
