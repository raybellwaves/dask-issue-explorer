See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:\r\n\r\n- Craft Minimal Bug Reports http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports\r\n- Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nBug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the issue**:\r\nWhen attempting to sort a dataframe by a nullable numeric column (e.g. `Int64`) that has a partition made up entirely of `pd.NA`, we fail at the computation of divisions with `TypeError: boolean value of NA is ambiguous`.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the underlying issue here is that the various algorithms behind `_repartition_quantiles` (specifically `merge_and_compress_summaries` and `process_val_weights`) have support for `np.nan` but not `pd.NA`.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\": [2, 3, 1, 2, None, None]})\r\ndf[\"a\"] = df[\"a\"].astype(\"Int64\")\r\n\r\nddf = dd.from_pandas(df, npartitions=3)\r\nddf.sort_values(\"a\")\r\n```\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: latest\r\n- Python version: 3.10\r\n- Operating System: ubuntu20.04\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): source\r\n",
