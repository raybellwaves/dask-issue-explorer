However, this argument is never popped from kwargs, meaning `reconstruct_func` is called with `numeric_only=True` still in kwargs, and results in `is_multi_agg_with_relabel` returning False, as it doesn't match a relabel aggregation. This causes a `TypeError: Must provide 'func' or tuples of '(column, aggfunc).`",
