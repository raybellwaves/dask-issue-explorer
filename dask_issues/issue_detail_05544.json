    "body": "I want to reshape a 4D dask array in such a way that I expect should preserve the original chunk structure. I am finding that `reshape` is instead rechunking my array in a non-optimal way.\r\n\r\nThings work as expected in 3D:\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as dsa\r\ndata = dsa.ones((20, 20, 5), chunks=(10, 10, 5))\r\ndisplay(data)\r\ndsa.reshape(data, (400, 5))\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1197350/67893356-d90ab080-fb2c-11e9-9b05-3938df254d4c.png)\r\n\r\nThe chunks simply get stacked into a single column. Examining the graph, however, reveals there is an intermediate merge step:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1197350/67893884-d9f01200-fb2d-11e9-8962-28a80b28d663.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I add another dimension at the beginning, things don't look as nice:\r\n```python\r\ndata = dsa.ones((2, 20, 20, 5), chunks=(1, 10, 10, 5))\r\ndisplay(data)\r\ndsa.reshape(data, (800, 5))\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1197350/67893508-13744d80-fb2d-11e9-96f0-0cd92b942f75.png)\r\n\r\nRather than seeing a neat stack of 8 chunks as I expected, the chunks have been fused.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1197350/67893915-ea07f180-fb2d-11e9-9c4e-2936dcf6f01e.png)\r\n\r\nThis causes big problems for me when I am trying to do some processing of very large arrays. I can't afford to have the chunks fused, or else I will run out of memory.\r\n\r\nDask version 2.6.0+10.g8179f7f3",
