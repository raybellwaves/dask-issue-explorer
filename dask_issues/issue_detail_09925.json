However, I encountered a troubling complex graph when doing an operation like `array[array > 100]`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\narr = da.random.random((200,200,200), chunks=(20, 20, 20))\r\narr[arr > 1].dask\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8629629/217204020-daa896a5-0005-4ee9-861d-23a52cb5b167.png)\r\n\r\nThis is under the hood raveling the arrays before indexing. Raveling is effectively a rechunking operation which is relatively expensive, specifically for an operation that should be elemwise.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if I'm missing anything here or why there is a reason for this complexity",
