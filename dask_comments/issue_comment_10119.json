It would be really nice to clear up our namespace.\r\n\r\nTo clarify a bit, the example of `dask.utils._deprecated` suggests that the `dask.utils` package is public and anyone can import things from within. But the `dask.utils._deprecated` function is private and can't be used outside of `dask.utils`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I expect the intent is that `dask.utils._deprecated` is intended for use from anywhere within `dask` (and `distributed`?) but not other packages.

        "body": "Yeah, agreed that `dask.utils._deprecated` should move to `dask._utils.deprecated` (similarly for other currently private methods). Things that don't have underscores, but are intended to be private should just move into a private module as-is (e.g. `dask.utils.foo` --> `dask._utils.foo`). Public utilities can stay in `dask.utils`. \r\n\r\n> and `distributed`?\r\n\r\nI'd welcome thoughts from others here. My current thinking is `dask` and `distributed` are co-developed, so I think `distributed` using private code is fine.
