        "body": "_edit: simplify implementation_\r\nHi, I'm trying to implement this and I would like to put my thoughts here and perhaps get some comments.\r\n\r\n# Context\r\nI'm interested about having a `take_along_axis` implementation to be able to exploit the result of argtopk or similar function results, for ndarrays. For example, we can't do the following at the moment:\r\n```py\r\nimport dask as da\r\n\r\ndata = da.arange(150, chunks=5).reshape(10,15)\r\nindices = data.argtopk(10, axis=-1)\r\n\r\nda.take_along_axis(data, indices, axis=-1) # not working\r\n```\r\nAnd I don't see how to map_blocks numpy's take_along_axis.\r\nOnce `take_along_axis` exists in dask, I will _try_ to implement a distributed_percentile function for ndarray, this will be very useful for the computation of climate indices. For now we rely on xarray.apply_ufunc which requires some rechunking beforehand, thus is slow and ram intensive.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nBuilding on the ideas from @crusaderky 's comments above I think the goal here is to turn `indices` into a mask that will have the same shape as `data` and then use `data[indices_mask]` to select the values (see the example below for details). \r\nI want to divide this in 3 steps:\r\n- For each chunk of `indices`, build the corresponding masked_chunk.\r\n- On combine chunk level, combine the masks into a `indices_mask` .\r\n- At last, apply the mask and reshape to `indices.shape`.\r\n\r\n#### Drawbacks \r\nAs @crusaderky already suggested:\r\n- It's not very RAM friendly because our `indices_mask` will have the same shape as `data`, so potentially large (see the implementation details below).\r\n- It's not the most efficient because building a mask for every chunk also which nullify the benefit of having a `indices` ndarray that is smaller than `data`. Worst case scenario is when using a `argmax` function which means we are interested in only one value (for a given axis), but we have to as long as the whole axis.\r\n\r\n#### Example of steps, using numpy \r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# [input] data \r\nIn [196]: arr\r\nOut[196]: \r\narray([[[ 0,  1,  2,  3],\r\n        [ 4,  5,  6,  7]],\r\n\r\n       [[ 8,  9, 10, 11],\r\n        [12, 13, 14, 15]]])\r\n\r\n# [input] indices of interest (could be the result of `argtopk(k =3, axis = -1)`)\r\nIn [206]: indices\r\nOut[206]: \r\narray([[[1, 2, 3],\r\n        [1, 2, 3]],\r\n\r\n       [[1, 2, 3],\r\n        [1, 2, 3]]])\r\n\r\n# [intermediary output] Mask of indices with arr shape\r\nIn [217]: indices_mask\r\nOut[217]: \r\narray([[[False,  True,  True,  True],\r\n        [False,  True,  True,  True]],\r\n\r\n       [[False,  True,  True,  True],\r\n        [False,  True,  True,  True]]])\r\n\r\n# [output result] Equivalent to `np.take_along_axis(arr, indices, axis=-1)`\r\nIn [218]: np.reshape(arr[indices_mask], indices.shape)\r\nOut[218]: \r\narray([[[ 1,  2,  3],\r\n        [ 5,  6,  7]],\r\n\r\n       [[ 9, 10, 11],\r\n        [13, 14, 15]]])\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n#### Implementation details\r\n\r\n`take_along_axis` will be declared in array.reduction.py. \r\nIt will be built around `reduction` function, similarly to what is done on `topk/argtopk`.\r\n\r\nAt chunk level, a function `get_chunk_mask_for_take_along_axis` (names can be changed) will have 1 argument, a chunk of `indices. It will compute the corresponding mask for this specific chunk and returns it.  \r\n\r\nOnce every chunk has returned it's corresponding mask, a `aggregate_masks_for_take_along_axis` function will combine them and return a final mask.  \r\n\r\nFinally, a `final_aggregate_for_take_along_axis` will apply the mask and reshape the result.\r\n\r\n# Final thoughts\r\nI'm sure there are several things we can optimize here.\r\nI will work on this implementation now, but I'm not in a hurry, I would happily read any suggestion and try to implement them.\r\n",

        "body": "Awesome Klaus, many thanks! I just replaced the sparse arrays with numpy arrays and it works as expected, probably not as memory efficient, but I don't think adding a dependency to sparse would be ok here.\r\nI will add a few unit test, check the perfs on a large dataset and PR this, unless you want to do it yourself of course (I will add you as co-author of the commit in any case).\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I see that climix has already implemented the idea I had for distributed_percentile via argtopk, I will probably take some inspiration for that as well!",
