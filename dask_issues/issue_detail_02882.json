    "body": "xarray, netCDF4-Python and now zarr (https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarr/pull/172) support a form of \"outer indexing\", where each axis is indexed independently, without broadcasting. See `oindex` in @seberg's draft NEP for details: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/6256.\r\n\r\nIn dask, we currently support a subset of this behavior, allowing for only at most one list-like indexing. This is almost (but [not always](https://github.com/alimanfoo/zarr/pull/172#issuecomment-340745599)) consistent with NumPy's standard indexing.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a dedicated indexing method that support outer indexing along multiple dimensions at once. This would allow xarray to remove [some hacks](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/master/xarray/core/indexing.py#L548-L556) it currently has to implement outer indexing in dask, and potentially allow dask array's optimization rules to consolidate repeated outer indexing.",
