    "body": "As requested by @jakirkham I'm creating a github issue for this. I started this conversation on gitter and was about to make a SO question but have posted it here instead.\r\n\r\nI have a custom array-like object that wraps a file-like object and I pass this custom object to Dask's `store` function to save a dask array. You can see an earlier implementation of that class [here][1] but it shouldn't matter for this question. So the issue I'm having is how to pass a file-like object as a target and have it explicitly closed. In normal execution the file seems to be closed after dask computes everything, in my unit tests with python's `unittest` the file seems to get closed before dask computes when I call it like this:\r\n\r\n    with MyFileObject(...) as my_file:\r\n        return da.store(my_data, my_file, compute=False)\r\n    ...\r\n    result.compute()  # compute the above delayed\r\n\r\nI then decided to try using `dask.delayed` around a function that opens the file, runs store, then closes the file. But then I realized that `delayed` will compute my dask array before passing it to my function, defeating the purpose of using `da.store` for storing chunks.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is there any way to use `da.store` with a file-like object, explicitly close that file-like object, and get the benefits of `da.store` storing individual chunks?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49090399/thread-safe-rasterio-writes-from-dask-array-store\r\n",
