It would be nice if we could move all graph-build-time filesystem operations (e.g. globbing files, etc...) to be run as tasks on the workers instead of locally. If needed this could be done by a configuration parameter, but I suspect we may want to do this always. This could also be used to parallelize filesystem operations during setup as well.",
