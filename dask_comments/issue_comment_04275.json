        "body": "Thanks for writing this up @qwitwa .\r\n\r\nConcretely I think that we should do a few things:\r\n\r\n1.  Add a configuration option, perhaps `tokenize` which controls whether or not we tokenize potentially large objects like numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes.  This would affect either the `normalize_token` functions in `dask/base.py` or functions like `dask.array.asarray(..., name=)` and `dask.dataframe.from_pandas(..., name=)`. \r\n2.  Add a timer around either the `dask.base.tokenize` function generally, or perhaps around the `normalize_token` functions for numpy arrays and dask dataframes specifically, that raises a warning if tokenization time takes longer than we would like.  This would presumably require calling `default_timer` before and after a function call and then `warnings.warn` if necessary.\r\n3.  Add a best practices guide for dask array.  However, I think that this will probably take more time and effort than the tasks above, and will probably require focus from someone who has had extensive experience supporting a few different use cases (@jakirkham maybe?).\r\n\r\nThe first two tasks here should be relatively straightforward for a new contributor, but not entirely trivial.  I'm going to list this as a \"good second issue\"",
