The issue with Dask is you can't create a new column with an integer name. Your `.astype` will change the type of the *values*, not the column names.\r\n\r\nFor now, I would recommend either using string names, or creating them first as strings, and then `.renaming`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [15]: ddf['1'] = 1\r\n\r\nIn [16]: ddf.rename(columns={'1': 1})\r\nOut[16]:\r\nDask DataFrame Structure:\r\n                   A      1\r\nnpartitions=1\r\n0              int64  int64\r\n1                ...    ...\r\nDask Name: rename, 3 tasks\r\n\r\nIn [17]: ddf.rename(columns={'1': 1}).columns\r\nOut[17]: Index(['A', 1], dtype='object')\r\n```",
