    "body": "I find myself very, very frequently needing to optimize the graph of a dask array and then put it back into the dask array itself. This is a boring and laborious work, which could be eased with a couple of straightforward changes:\r\n\r\n1. Change the dask collection interface to specify that a collection that defines ``__dask_graph__`` must also specify a ``copy(dsk=None)`` method. When it's invoked with dsk not None, the method creates a copy of the collection with a replaced dask graph.\r\n2. Create a new module dask.collection.optimization which defines cull, fuse, inline, inline_functions:\r\n```\r\nfrom ... import optimization as oz\r\ndef cull(coll):\r\n    dsk, dependencies = oz.cull(coll.__dask_graph__(), coll.__dask_keys__())\r\n    return coll.copy(dsk=dsk), dependencies\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, one could modify the current cull, etc. functions to dynamically detect if the first argument is a dask collection - but I find it a bit more convoluted.",
