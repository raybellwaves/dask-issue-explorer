        "body": "I agree that this has been a long-standing pain point. Dask implicitly encourages a functional style of programming and function composition, so it's surprising that it doesn't play nice with one of the most common tools for functional programming in python: `functools.partial`. For the same reason, it would be nice if dask correctly handled partials inside `cytoolz.compose` chains.",
