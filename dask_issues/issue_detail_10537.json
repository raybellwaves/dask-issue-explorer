    "body": "Sometimes third party libraries want to re-use the dask config system (Coiled for instance).\r\n\r\nWhat we currently do is to write some global state into the `~/.config/dask/` directory to store some user specific global state (e.g. an account name).\r\n\r\nSince the config system is a bit elaborate and there are actually many places where this config may live, it would be nice for dask to offer an API to do just this.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# dask.config\r\ndef write(basename: str, config_dict: dict):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    basename: str\r\n         The filename for the new config file\r\n    config_dict: str\r\n        The configuration that should be written to this file\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe path of that file would then be determined by dask in precedence order. Trying to write to the location with highest precedence (accounting for environment vars and everything) and walking backwards in case the directory is protected or something similar prohibits us from creating this file (e.g. https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/10536)\r\n\r\nThis way, whoever calls `dask.config.write` can be certain that the configuration will also be read by dask",
