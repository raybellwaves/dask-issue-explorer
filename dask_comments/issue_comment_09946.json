        "body": "Some thoughts on this:\r\n- do we want dask[dataframe] (or just dask in conda) to depend on pyarrow? If not, having string[pyarrow] as default would require annoying code to work around the possibility of it not being installed\r\n- I recommend against *changing* dtypes that were in a dataframe supplied by the user, e.g., from_pandas, from_delayed. Maybe they have a good reason for their choice and would end up transforming back\r\n- we should carefully check the API coverage of string[pyarrow]; my impression is that most things are vectorized, but are there some that still coerce back to python strings for operations? What about things that don't map to simple types, e.g., `split()`?\r\n- fastparquet does not produce string[pyarrow] since one of its main selling points is the smaller install requirements",
