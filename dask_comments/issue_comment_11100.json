        "body": "@phofl thinking about this a bit more, I think it's also possible that using tabs rather than links will be nicer.  I think that this is especially true if each of the getting started sub-pages are relatively small/simple.  In this case I could imagine a single tabbed section (rather than lots of linked tabbed sections like we have today) about basic usage.  \r\n\r\nThere are reasons against this (the page gets more complex) but the main reasons for that I see are ...\r\n\r\n1.  People stay on the page (which is good, each link tends to result in non-trivial dropoff)\r\n2. We can reuse latter generic sections, like scaleout, rather than repeating them on all of the subpages\r\n\r\nJust a thought.  I think that a lot of figuring out the right design will become more obvious once we (you) start writing)",
