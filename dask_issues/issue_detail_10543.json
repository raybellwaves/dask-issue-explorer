I wanted to open this PR to see if adding type hinting more generally (initially I'd like to add it to all the array creation functions) would be welcome work? If so I'd be happy to either carry on and add type hints in one big PR, or split it all off into one PR per function.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find much discussion around type hints in the issue tracker / pull requests, so sorry if I missed any context around this!",
