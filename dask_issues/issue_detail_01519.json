One concern is that this might trigger a fail case for the dask scheduler (#874) when checks inevitably require looking at the entire dataset.\n\nThis is a more general solution to #97, inspired by the corresponding design from TensorFlow:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/check_ops.html#assert_negative\n",
