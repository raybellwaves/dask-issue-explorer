See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:\r\n\r\n- Craft Minimal Bug Reports http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports\r\n- Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nBug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What happened**:\r\n\r\nRecently, a customer had an issue running a Dask-based PyTorch workflow that would quietly and inexplicably (no errors or worker logs) kill kernels on clusters or even operating systems when working locally. \r\n\r\nThat workflow roughly looked like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask\r\nimport dask.bag as db\r\nfrom dask.distributed import Client\r\nfrom transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, BertTokenizer\r\n\r\ncluster = ...\r\nclient = Client(cluster)\r\n\r\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')\r\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\r\n\r\n# create the top level bag\r\nbag_of_text = db.read_text('s3://<somebucket>/reviews.*.json', blocksize='500kB')\r\n\r\ndangerous = (\r\n    bag_of_reviews\r\n        .map(detect_task, model, tokenizer, danger_threshold)\r\n        .filter(lambda x: x is not None)\r\n)\r\nflagged_reviews = dangerous.compute()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe catch here is that `model` and `tokenizer` are fairly large (~0.5 GB) objects, so creating them and passing them to all of the workers. @jcrist quickly recognized this and recommended that pass the objects to `dask.delayed` lets the scheduler make smarter decisions about how to create and re-use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nd_model, d_tokenizer = dask.delayed(model), dask.delayed(tokenizer)\r\ndangerous = (\r\n    bag_of_reviews\r\n        .map(detect_task, d_model, d_tokenizer, danger_threshold)\r\n        .filter(lambda x: x is not None)\r\n)\r\nflagged_reviews = dangerous.compute()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis strategy worked great and allowed us to go back to the customer with really good advice. \r\n\r\nHowever, reading the [`delayed` docs](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/delayed.html) don't mention this as a viable strategy. I walked away from those docs thinking that `delayed` only worked on function. \r\n\r\n**What you expected to happen**:\r\n\r\nWe should add a section to the docs explaining cases where `delayed` is useful on non-function objects.\r\n\r\n",
