        "body": "This is not very helpful to this issue as posted, but I'd just like to put in a placeholder to note that array assignment with `__setitem__` deliberately copied the `__getitem__` capabilities. In `def parse_assignment_indices`, used by `__setitem__`, we have:\r\n\r\n```python \r\n    # Disallow scalar boolean indexing, and also indexing by scalar\r\n    # numpy or dask array.\r\n    #\r\n    # numpy allows these, but Array.__getitem__ does not yet implement\r\n    # them properly, so disallow it for now in __setitem__\r\n```\r\n(https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/2021.07.1/dask/array/slicing.py#L1397-L1415)\r\n\r\nSo if indexing by numpy scalars were to be enabled in `__getitem__` it would be good to allow it in `__setitem__` as well. I would be happy make a PR for setitem in the event it is needed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid",
