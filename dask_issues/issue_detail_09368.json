In other CI jobs we use [this script](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/e2548c53db70929e42aa8cdac18bee552a291adb/continuous_integration/scripts/install.sh) to install the development version of a few upstream dependencies (including `pandas`). However, I don't think the same thing is done in our gpuCI builds today. \r\n\r\ncc @charlesbluca",
