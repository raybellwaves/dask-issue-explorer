    "body": "For Dask Array, currently the `copy` method is basically a no-op that creates a new Dask Array object unless it is a single chunk, in which case it calls `.copy` on that chunk. However it might make a bit more sense to use `map_blocks` to call `copy` on all chunks regardless of how many there are. This would provide a solution (albeit a manual one) to [problems like this one]( https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/3595#issuecomment-449544992 ). It would also make the behavior here a bit easier to understand.\r\n\r\nAdditionally it would be valuable to have a `copy` function to override `np.copy` with. This would help in user code like `np.copy(a)` where `a` is a Dask Array. Currently this materializes a NumPy array, which is not likely what users would expect.",
