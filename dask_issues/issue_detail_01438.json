    "body": "Normally, `take` seems to intelligently \"propagate\" its way down, so that a `take(1)` doesn't evaluate the entire task graph before . This is super useful for exploring large data sets.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't seem to work for \"diamond\" / shared dependencies (like those created with `zip`), where the task graph looks like:\n\n```\n     --------\n     | Take |\n     --------\n        /\\\n      /    \\\n    /        \\\n--------  --------\n| Task |  | Task |\n--------  --------\n    \\        /\n      \\    /\n        \\/\n     --------\n     | Base |\n     --------\n```\n\nIn this diamond dependency, even a trivial `take(1)` seems to evaluate the entire task graph, even though it should be easy to for `take(1)` to percolate down through the `zip`.\n\nI saw this on Python 3.5 and dask `0.10.2` (both from `conda-forge`).\n",
