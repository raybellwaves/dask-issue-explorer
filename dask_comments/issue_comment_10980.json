        "body": "So the first issue seems to have a host of issues (`X_dask[X_dask > 0].compute()`) including lack of 1D support in `scipy.sparse` and also a general incompatibility with `dask` and `np/sp.matrix` but the second issue has a more direct cause because there is no `np.where` equivalent in `scipy.sparse`.  This can be easily reproduced with\r\n\r\n```python\r\nnp.where(X>0, 10, X)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this sort of setting does work in general\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmask = X>0\r\nX[X>0] = 10\r\nX[mask] # all 10's\r\n```",
