        "body": "Brief update here: turns out pandas ExtensionArrays don't work as dask.Array chunks/meta out of the box. There are many places throughout the Array code where we expect `arr.dtype` to be a NumPy dtype, and construct NumPy arrays directly, rather than using whatever type `meta` is. In practice, this means both elemwise operations (`arr + 1`) and reductions (`arr.mean()`) don't work.\r\n\r\nSome of this should be pretty easy to fix; I'm pushing a commit here (d6fe64fb040085cd13dda6163a7fff9badd91204) that gets elemwise and some reductions sorta working. But there are other things that will be difficult to generalize to arbitrary duck dtypes: for example, the `argmin`/`argmax` implementation is heavily reliant on `arr.dtype` being a NumPy dtype, since it constructs a NumPy structured dtype around it.",
