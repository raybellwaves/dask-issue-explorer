    "body": "**Describe the issue**:\r\nIn my code, I try to reshape the array ```Y``` from shape ```(36,36,36,468)``` to ```(46656,468)``` and limit the max size to ```32MiB```. In this case, the chunk size of ```Y``` is ```(18,18,36,468)->(9,36,36,468)->(11664,468)```, which is larger than ```32MiB```(because the data type is complex128), so the chunk of ```Y``` is splited to ```(4266,468)```$\\times 10$ and ```(3996,468)```$\\times 1$. But when we compute or persist ```Y```, the following error arise:\r\n```ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 5458752 into shape (4266,468)```\r\nIt seems that the dask array is trying to reshape the chunk ```(11664,468)``` to ```(4266,468)``` but not split.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nDcut=36\r\nl=Dcut*13\r\nN=int(Dcut**3)\r\nn=2\r\nrs = da.random.RandomState(seed=1234, RandomState=np.random.RandomState)\r\n\r\nchunks_Y=(Dcut/n, Dcut/n, Dcut, l)\r\nY = rs.normal(size=(Dcut,Dcut,Dcut,l), chunks=chunks_Y).astype(np.complex128)\r\nY = da.reshape(Y, shape=(N,l), limit='32M')\r\nY=Y.persist()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2023.1.1\r\n- Python version: 3.10\r\n- Operating System: Red Hat\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): conda-forge\r\n",
