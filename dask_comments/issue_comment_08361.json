I also wonder just how many users' workflows are failing because of this precise issue. I did hear that \"what I do is embarrassingly parallelizable, so why do I always resort to looping over chunks of data\" sentiment a number of times at the summit, possibly suggesting Dask introduces some unexpected dependency between partitions.\r\n\r\nOn the API side, the reason why I didn't even think of mapping `groupby` using `map_partitions` at first is that it felt like I'm somehow circumventing Dask and doing something hacky and possibly wrong. \r\n\r\n>  For example: in divisions=[0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5], the partitions containing 1-2, 2-2, and 2-4 would need to be combined, probably using the normal apply_concat_apply logic.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, you're suggesting that the same index could actually be present in multiple partitions? Empirically, I've actually never seen that happen, even when it would make sense in terms of balancing the partitions. Here is a related SO question: [Dask dataframe: Can `set_index` put a single index into multiple partitions?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69570717/dask-dataframe-can-set-index-put-a-single-index-into-multiple-partitions).

Otherwise we would need to reimplement all the groupby methods to act on non groupby objects. As an experiment I tried implementing just `first` as a map_partitions with no groupby per-chunk, but the implementation of `df.first` is different than the implementation of `groupby.first` so it didn't work quite how I had hoped. So if we need to do a groupby per-chunk and we might occassionally need to aggregate across results (for the case of duplicate divisions), I'm not quite sure I see a big opportunity for optimization here.

Sorry I didn't make that clear!\r\n\r\n> I'm not quite sure I see a big opportunity for optimization here. Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nSkipping a full `aca` is huge win (see the graphs in the [blog post](https://targomo.medium.com/how-we-learned-to-love-dask-and-achieved-a-40x-speedup-aa14e72d99c0#fa71) for an example). It avoids needlessly doing a tree-reduction and concatenating all those partitions, which saves a ton of data transfer, of tasks, and of memory from all the concatenations.\r\n\r\n> we might occassionally need to aggregate across results (for the case of duplicate divisions)\r\n\r\nI think we should error on this case for now since it's probably invalid at the moment (https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8437). But even when we do support it, I'd expect that typically:\r\n1. It's rare to have duplicate divisions at all\r\n2. When there are duplicate divisions, the number of duplicates compared to the number of non-duplicates is small\r\n2. When there are duplicate divisions, the length of each consecutive run is short compared to the total number of divisions\r\n\r\nWhich if true, means that for a DataFrame of say, 1,000 partitions, we'd have maybe 10-100 partitions getting `aca`'d (with multiple shallower trees), instead of all 1,000 getting `aca`'d.",
