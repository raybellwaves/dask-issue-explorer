It is supposed to demonstrate the problem and facilitate discussion. It simply reverts the changes made in  https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/6846\r\n\r\nWith this commit, [the dask glm cupy demo notebook](https://github.com/daxiongshu/rapids-demos/blob/master/dask_glm_Multi-GPU_demo.ipynb) can achieve its original speedup and scales to 100GB.\r\n",
