This PR proposes that we allow the `chunk` function to handle hash-based sharding by skipping the `hash_shard` call in `aca` when the output of `chunk` is already a `dict` with the expected keys (e.g. `[0, split_out)`).\r\n\r\n- [x] Closes #9509\r\n- [x] Tests added / passed\r\n- [x] Passes `pre-commit run --all-files`\r\n",
