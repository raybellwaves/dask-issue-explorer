It would be good/interesting to benchmark this implementation and see if there are any easy gains we're missing (this was never done). This would ideally be done at two levels:\r\n\r\n- Pandas/Arrow (are we getting the bandwidth we'd expect from the ORC c++ reader)\r\n- Dask (are we getting parallelism, is our overhead low)\r\n\r\nWe'd need to use some other system (spark, hive, etc...) to generate test files, as no python writer exists.",
