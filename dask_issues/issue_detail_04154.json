    "body": "Would the a addition of a method `da.overlapped_from_array` be appropriate. \r\n\r\nIn this method, under the applicable circumstances, an overlapped array is created from a single memory view into an existing numpy array. This would solve the `da.from_array`, `da.overlapped` issue whereby a fully new array is created when overlapping regions.\r\n\r\nI think this kind of stuff would really help people ease into dask. It would definitely help the scikit-image community which probably has most of their code written for a single CPU.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this isn't a bottlekneck for me now, but I just wanted to put it out there since it seems like overlapping computations is gaining more attention.\r\n\r\ncc. @jakirkham \r\n",
