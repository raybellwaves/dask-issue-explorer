Personally, I prefer keeping all my relevant information in there instead of Googling or searching directly on the website and it helps for developing with an unstable internet connection.\r\n\r\nDocsets can be build using [doc2dash](https://github.com/hynek/doc2dash) and it looks like someone has already gone through this effort at some point in time, though the contributed docsets for [dask](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions/tree/master/docsets/Dask) and [distributed](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions/tree/master/docsets/Distributed) are outdated. To avoid the PR-based publishing workflow on the [Dash-User-Contributions](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions/) repo, I'd also suggest publishing our own docset feed (see [https://kapeli.com/docsets#sharedocsetfeed](https://kapeli.com/docsets#sharedocsetfeed) for more information).\r\n\r\n**cc** @jsignell, @jacobtomlinson and @scharlottej13 ",
