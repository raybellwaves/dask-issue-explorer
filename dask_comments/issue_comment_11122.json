        "body": "A couple of things here.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this issue is actually a bit more work than I initially anticipated. A while ago we migrated to a new dataframe backend using https://github.com/dask/dask-expr\r\nWe had to move over a couple of different doc strings, see for example https://github.com/dask/dask-expr/pull/1051. These doc strings should also has to be added in that repo.\r\n\r\nThe original docs for read_csv, read_fwf and read_table where actually auto generated using a template, see \r\n [READ_DOC_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/d6f1f077d47432fcac62e3f729e28a1ebede14bb/dask/dataframe/io/csv.py#L682)\r\n\r\nI suspect we can use the same template but will require a slightly different mechanism. I suspect adding\r\n\r\n```\r\nread_csv.__doc__ = READ_DOC_TEMPLATE.format(reader=\"read_csv\", file_type=\"CSV\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nand similar for FWF and table should do the trick. (See [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/d6f1f077d47432fcac62e3f729e28a1ebede14bb/dask/dataframe/io/csv.py#L791-L798) where the legacy readers are defined)",
