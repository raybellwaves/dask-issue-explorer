        "body": "FWIW, exposing these would help with early adoption of Dask into SciPy. Now that we have `array_api_compat.dask`, we should be able to get our array-agnostic code working.\r\n\r\nThe slight problem at the minute is that in our tests, we make some assumptions about very basic things that NumPy, CuPy, PyTorch and the standard all have in common, such as `xp.float64`. This assumption has allowed us to reduce diffs quite a lot by avoiding (so far) unnecessary calls to get the wrapped namespaces.\r\n\r\nI understand that resolution to this may be somewhat blocked on a resolution to whether converging the main namespace or adding a separate namespace is desirable in gh-8750. For now though, even just exposing the dtypes as @ogrisel suggested would be helpful. Thanks!",
