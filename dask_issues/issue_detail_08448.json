    "body": "We're starting to realize how critical the task fusion optimization is for avoiding task overproduction (see dask/distributed#5555, dask/distributed#5223 for background). \r\n\r\nIn light of this and https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/8447, I think we should add the `fuse` optimization for `delayed` as well, which currently doesn't have it: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a5aecac8313fea30c5503f534c71f325b1775b9c/dask/delayed.py#L472-L478\r\n\r\nI could see the counterargument that Delayed is lower-level, and users expect each of their delayed functions to run as a separate task. I'm not sure how much users want this, versus want help avoiding the very poor scheduling we currently have for unfused chains. We could always take the https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7620 approach and have `optimization.fuse.active=None` fuse Delayed by default, but turn off fusion if explicitly set to False.\r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora @ian-r-rose @jcrist @jrbourbeau ",
