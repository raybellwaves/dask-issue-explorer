    "body": "For reference: da.linalg.norm for the moment does not support SVD based norms on 2D slices of ndimensional arrays, i.e. stacks of matrices as np.linalg.norm _does_ support. \r\nFrom issue #3895, which was resolved by PR #3933 :\r\n\r\n> Except for the SVD-based norms on slices of ND arrays. I see that np.linalg itself only supports operating on the last two dimensions of ND-arrays for the svd here: > https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.linalg.html#linear-algebra-on-several-matrices-at-once, although np.linalg.norm handles this somehow.\r\nThis means we can either create some application of map_blocks/apply_along_axes on the existing da.linalg.svr (or the underlying da.linalg.tsqr) in this case for norm, or extend one of these to operate on the last 2 dimensions of an N-D array, or to take an axis argument, respectively replicating or superseding the stacked linalg computation functionality of numpy.\r\n\r\nI guess matching numpy functionality and operate on the last two dimensions would be the best, as introducing a full axis argument for svd/tsqr would just hide away an underlying transpose.",
