You are correct that the work-around is to check for single-element `MaterializedLayer` instances with a value that is not a task or a key. It feels cleaner and more convenient to label the specialized layer at creation time, and avoid the need to search through every MaterializedLayer, but I do understand the motivation to avoid adding a new class here (for now).",
