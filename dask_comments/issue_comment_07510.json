        "body": "> One question that comes up with this is whether we like the parameter name, `chunksize` (taken from `concurrent.futures` and used elsewhere ( [dask/distributed#3650](https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/3650) )) or if that's confusing and we want to use something else like `batchsize`. \r\n\r\nI would find this a little confusing, and might lean towards `batchsize`.\r\n\r\n> Another question is this sits at the top-level config (similar to other things like [`pool` and `num_workers`](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/a31c0fc72e1cc59b8b0254965824abb0718c5f56/dask/multiprocessing.py#L179-L180)), is that where we want this? Lastly is this parameter useful outside the local scheduler (like would Distributed want to use this)\r\n\r\nI don't think I can comment sensibly on this, but perhaps @tomwhite or @jcrist have thoughts.",
