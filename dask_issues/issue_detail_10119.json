    "body": "We have lots of utilities throughout our codebase and we're not very vigilant about indicating which ones are intended to be public and which are private. Some methods like `dask.utils._deprecated` are marked as private\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/0cbc46ac89b6f6a2cf949f2fd73c4c1175419db5/dask/utils.py#L78-L85\r\n\r\nbut most aren't marked with a leading underscore and also aren't meant for public consumption. \r\n\r\nThis lack of public vs. private specification causes issues like https://github.com/dask/dask/issues/10112. I think we should move utilities are that are intended to be private into a private module (e.g. `dask._utils`) -- we'll also want to emit deprecation warnings appropriately. \r\n\r\nNote that we do have [some public utilities](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/api.html#utilities), so this wouldn't be a blanket \"move everything into private modules\". But I suspect most things in, for example, `dask.utils_test` and `dask.compatibility` can be moved over into private modules (xref https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/10114). \r\n\r\ncc @jacobtomlinson for visibility \r\n\r\nAlso cc @fjetter @crusaderky @hendrikmakait as I think the same argument applies to `dask/distributed` \r\n",
