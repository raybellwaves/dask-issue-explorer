    "body": "The abstraction of a distributed worker, which is totally detached from the physical machine on which it runs is awesome in the capability it adds to seamlessly move the same code from single-core > multi-core > multi-machine. However, it does present some significant limitations.\r\n\r\nA notable example is that when the majority of the work is GIL-intensive (i.e. does not free-up the GIL very often), then the best-practice is to run workers with `nthreads=1`. In the distributed setting this means that multiple workers are spawned on each machine in the cluster and there is no good way to manage their shared resources - most importantly RAM, and network bandwidth. Workarounds using [locks or resources](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45915267/dask-worker-resources-for-distributed-workers) fall short since the scheduler is blind to workers residing on the same machine, hence it's unable to make \"smart\" choices w.r.t them.\r\n\r\nAllowing resources to be specified **accross** multiple workers could provide a very flexible yet simple solution.
