See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:\r\n\r\n- Craft Minimal Bug Reports http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports\r\n- Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n\r\nBug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose, and so are often handled much more quickly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the issue**:\r\nI have 20000 parquet files partitioned by name. `read_parquet` hangs when I give parquet folder as input. I tried glob pattern and that is also same. However, when I tried passing the list of parquet files, it takes fraction of a second.\r\n\r\n**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npaths = [f'az://parquet/phone/name={name}/{name}.parquet' for name in names]\r\npath = 'az://parquet/phone'\r\ngpath = 'az://parquet/phone/**/*.parquet'\r\n\r\ndef read_parquet(p):\r\n    df = dd.read_parquet(p, engine=\"pyarrow\", columns=col_list, index=ind_list, storage_options=storage_options,dataset ={\"schema\":SCHEMA,\"format\":\"parquet\"})\r\n    return df\r\n\r\ndf = read_parquet(paths) # Fraction of a second \r\ndf = read_parquet(path) # Hangs and there is no task in the dashboard\r\ndf = read_parquet(gpath) # Hangs and there is no task in the dashboard\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Anything else we need to know?**:\r\nIn case of folder path, when I interrupt, same set of lines are always highlighted by Jupyter notebook,\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16543422/197110974-34389c6f-a2a4-46e5-813b-3a29adb61ec8.png)\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- All my parquet files has same schema\r\n- There could be couple of corrupted files (say <10)\r\n- I am not able share the data here, sorry.\r\n\r\n**Environment**:\r\n\r\n- Dask version: 2022.10.0\r\n- Python version: 3.8.13\r\n- Operating System: Windows\r\n- Install method (conda, pip, source): pip\r\n",
