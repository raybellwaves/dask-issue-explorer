Currently, this just implements tokenization and concatenation.\r\n\r\nThese classes are currently under development, so some less than ideal code has been needed for concatenation. Ideally this could be removed once scipy allows concatenating sparse arrays such that an array (and not a matrix) is returned. However, I'm not totally clear on how dask does minimum versions of its dependencies.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I have found some info on minimum test versions via failing tests \ud83d\ude05",
