    "body": "Intel made an [`mkl_fft`]( https://github.com/IntelPython/mkl_fft ) library, which follows the NumPy API. As such it would be an easy thing to wrap with Dask Arrays' [`fft_wrap`]( http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array-api.html#dask.array.fft.fft_wrap ) function. Thus generating Dask Array friendly FFT functions that would leverage MKL for the computation in chunks. Would be interesting to write these and compare how they perform against other implementations (e.g. NumPy, SciPy, pyFFTW, etc.).",
