If we use this for other types we'll also call `hash_buffer`. I think specifying `hash_buffer` as a single global option makes the most sense, no need to add another knob that's unused.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to have reproducibility between sessions (if not then we have a bug). I'm hesitant to make guarantees across versions of dask though, as the underlying hashing algorithms *may* change. This has happened several times over the years whether for improved correctness or performance.",
