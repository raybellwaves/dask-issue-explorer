Overall, I'm all in favor of improving our documentation navigation experience \ud83d\udc4d\r\n\r\nLooking at the current proposal, it seems like we're dropping some pages I often reference (e.g. FAQ, development guidelines, how to). Where will those pages live? \r\n\r\nAlso, where will the current array, DataFrame, bag, etc. pages live? Are those nested inside the \"Collections\" page?\r\n\r\n> HOME: Ideally we will have the collections -> TG -> Scheduler image in https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/ to be at the top and it will be clickable, so you can click in let's say \"Dask Array\" and that will lead you to the array page.\r\n\r\nNice. That would be great to have\r\n\r\ncc @mrocklin, who I think also has thoughts on this topic, for visibility ",
