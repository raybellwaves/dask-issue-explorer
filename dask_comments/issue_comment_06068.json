It looks like there's an issue with metadata handling where a `Series` is getting passed to a code branch that is expecting a `DataFrame`. Are you interested in looking deeper into this issue?

        "body": "I took a stab at this and believe the real issue is related to pandas - [ref](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/31063).  Each `df` passed to [_groupby_slice_apply](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/895c9541044e16809151f0e3db95c48ea338c6d3/dask/dataframe/groupby.py#L172) has just one unique group. In that case, the pandas bug returns a dataframe instead of a boolean series. \r\n\r\nThe other issue was that because of this, in [apply_and_enforce](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/895c9541044e16809151f0e3db95c48ea338c6d3/dask/dataframe/core.py#L5476) we have a `df` as dataframe and `meta` which is a pandas series (what @victor-ab passed in as `meta` kwarg). I think we can improve the error message here to state that one of them is a series and the other is a dataframe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll check a bit more and get back on this ticket",

That is, check if the number of groups is 1, check if the return type is a df, if so, call `df.stack` before returning it.\r\nJust a workaround until the pandas issue is resolved. @jrbourbeau do you see some problems with this? \r\n\r\n",
