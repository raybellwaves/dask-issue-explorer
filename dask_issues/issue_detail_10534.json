    "body": "Closes #10518.\r\n\r\nThis mainly does three things:\r\n- Modifies `ArrayOverlapLayer` to allow partial materialization (i.e. {key:value} creation for only part of the full layer keys)\r\n- Allows querying the number of tasks in an `ArrayOverlapLayer` object, without needing to materialize the layer\r\n- Substitutes `get_all_external_keys` call within `HighLevelGraph.cull`, thus allowing the graph to be culled without materializing the full graph\r\n\r\nThe consequence of these changes are that subgraphs can now be created and computed independently of the overall data/graph size. See the issue referenced above for more details. \r\n\r\nI've tried to make minimal adjustments to the code to allow things to work and pass tests, so the substitution for `get_all_external_keys` just creates a thin wrapper around required functionality for `Layer.cull`. \r\n\r\nAs well, I've taken a brute-force approach for the full multi-dimensional length calculation in `ArrayOverlapLayer`. This can be replaced with an analytic solution, but I haven't yet fully worked out the formula for dimensions > 2. ",
