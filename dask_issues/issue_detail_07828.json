It:\r\n\r\n* Expands on the ways you can use Dask for GPUs (with specific collections, through multi-gpu libraries like PyTorch DDP, and through running concurrent model trainings)\r\n* Adds some images to help explain the uses (with Dask styling)\r\n* Adds credits for the linked video\r\n* Assorted other cleaning",
