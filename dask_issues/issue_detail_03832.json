    "body": "I'm pretty sure to get distributed writes working properly in xarray (https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/2261) we will need reentrant versions of `dask.utils.SerializableLock` and `distributed.Lock`, i.e., which can be acquired multiple times by the same thread like [`threading.RLock`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/threading.html#rlock-objects). These could potentially be useful for other projects using dask as well.\r\n\r\nContemplating how to write these is hurting my head a little bit. In principle, we could just make a forked version of `SerializableLock` that uses `RLock` internally, but for `distributed.Lock` it's less clear.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we could do this with composition, e.g., by writing `ReentrantLock(distributed.Lock(...))` to make a reentrant distributed lock. Does anyone have any idea what that would look like?",
