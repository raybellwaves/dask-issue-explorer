Now is probably also a good time to rethink that interface.  Currently the interface seems to be the following:\r\n\r\n- Mapping, so getitem, list keys, len\r\n- Cull\r\n\r\nWhat would make more sense?  I'd like to solicit information about what constraints on a design should be.  What do we need minimally?  Then after that (in a separate issue) let's think about what we might add on top.\r\n\r\ncc @rjzamora @ian-r-rose @jcrist ",
