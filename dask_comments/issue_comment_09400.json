There is definitely a lack of coverage for missing Parquet statistics, and it certainly makes sense to raise a clear warning (rather than a confusing error) when the necessary statistics for filtering or divisions are missing.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in raising a PR to address this? (No worries if not - I appreciate you taking the time to write this up either way)",

        "body": "@rjzamora , I would like to open a PR, but still some points are unclear to me.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not that the statistics are not provided per partion, but rather the `min` and `max` attributes of statistics. In this case it is `None`. (Please see [ref. ](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/main/dask/dataframe/io/parquet/core.py/#L1267-L1268))\r\n\r\nI think it is because of `ArrowDatasetEngine.read_metadata`. \r\n\r\nIs it the intended usage? \r\n\r\nAlso, would something like this be valid from your point of view?\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  min = c[\"min\"] or -float(\"inf\")\r\n  max = c[\"max\"] or float(\"inf\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nthanks",
