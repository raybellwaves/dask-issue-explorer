        "body": "I think this means point selection (like `a[0, 5]`), contiguous slicing (like `a[2:5]`), non-contiguous slicing (like `a[2:5:2]`), and reversed slicing (like `a[2:5:-1]`). If there is a place where documentation might help, feel free to submit a PR with some useful text where you were looking for this info. Would be happy to review \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nFancy indexing is more about selecting multiple points in different ways (inner indexing - just some points, outer indexing - grid of points with self-chosen spacing). Also supporting things like bools arrays for selection. I don't know if you use these at all. If not, I wouldn't worry about it.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that libraries like h5py, Zarr, etc. will take the first selection and then return a NumPy array. At which point everything works as expected (including fancy indexing). So this really only matters if you are trying to do fancy indexing as part of reading in data.\r\n\r\nMy guess is this won't matter much. I've yet to be bitten by a case where Dask tries to use fancy indexing on an object that doesn't support it. So probably worth just giving things a try and seeing if it works out or not. Happy to follow-up if you run into issues.",

I wouldn't worry about more sophisticated forms of indexing when saving data unless you are performing some more complex transform when writing out the data. If you are just doing a 1-to-1 mapping of Dask chunks to some slice in the stored array, then only basic slicing will be relevant.",
