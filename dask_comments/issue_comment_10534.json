I still don't have a lot of time to tackle it at the moment, but I think I'll get some free time to dig into it deeper within the next month or so. With that said, the main roadblock at this point is indeed testing it appropriately. \r\n\r\nThe other potential issue I see is something that I mentioned in one of the comments: this method allows for partially materializing the layer, in a just-in-time manner. While that's the key idea for the performance gains that this change offers, the potential issue is that the `is_materialized` flag becomes True if even a single value in the layer is created. I'm just unsure whether this behavior has the potential to cause some sort of bugs or performance degradation elsewhere in dask due to assumptions being made about the meaning of the `is_materialized` flag.",
