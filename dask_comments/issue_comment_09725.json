        "body": "We fixed a different issue but didn\u2019t catch this hang in manual testing because it only happens on Linux. We\u2019re setting up nightly runs of the Dask tests against TileDB-Py to catch this in the future.\r\n\r\nWe have a minimum reproduction of the issue with the script below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport tempfile, tiledb\r\nimport dask.array as da, numpy as np\r\nfrom dask.diagnostics import ResourceProfiler\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    uri = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile().name\r\n    _ = tiledb.from_numpy(uri, np.arange(0, 9).reshape(3, 3))  # create a tiledb array\r\n    tdb_ar = da.from_tiledb(uri)  # read back the array\r\n    tdb_ar.compute()\r\n\r\n    with ResourceProfiler() as prof:\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    print(\"done\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat we believe is happening is that we are creating a threadpool in TileDB. Using `ResourceProfiler()` as a context manager causes the script to hang because the `_Tracker` class inherits from `Process` which uses `fork` [here](https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/main/dask/diagnostics/profile.py#L215). `fork` does not re-initialize the TileDB threadpool and causes a spinlock as it cannot access the threadpool.\r\n\r\nWe were able to resolve the issue by inheriting from a `Process` class that uses the spawn method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport multiprocessing\r\nctx = multiprocessing.get_context('spawn')\r\n\r\nclass _Tracker(ctx.Process):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option might be to inherit from `multiprocessing.SpawnProcess`.\r\n\r\nWe are looking at improving fork-safety in the TileDB library (e.g. using `pthread_atfork`). However, are also floating the above idea as this issue with the `ResourceProfiler()` hang might be encountered by any library that uses multithreading (e.g. OpenBLAS and TBB have caused similar hangs in other libraries in the past).\r\n",
