    "body": "Hello (again!),\r\nWhen using dask-ssh specifying localhost as the scheduler, \"localhost\" is the address given to the workers, so no connection is made if the workers aren't on localhost as well. Easy solution is not specifying scheduler as localhost but as the \"actual\" address. Still a problem in my opinion, though! The console will repeatedly say:\r\n\r\n```[ worker NotARealMachine.edu ] : distributed.worker - INFO - Waiting to connect to: tcp://localhost:8786```\r\n\r\nreproduce:\r\n`dask-ssh --scheduler localhost NotARealMachine.edu AnotherFakemachine.edu`\r\nThis occurs for both TCP and TLS connections.",
