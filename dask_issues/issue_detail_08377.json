    "body": "Currently the \"Getting Started\" section does a few things really well. It explains how to install Dask and shows how to work with some synthetic data. Then it jumps to talks and tutorials, which are useful, but maybe a little time consuming (and possibly should be at the end of the section or a different one). While \"Best Practices\" is also useful, this is pretty heady for someone getting started (at least should be later in the listing). The \"How To\" part seems mostly to be deployment, which useful, but maybe we should just rename it that way? The FAQ part still seems useful (maybe the title can be clarified).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAs a starting user, my thought process would be:\r\n\r\n* What does this do? Why do I need it? \"10 Minutes to Dask\" answers this\r\n* How do I install it? \"Install Dask\" also answers this\r\n* How do I load my data? .... (unanswered) in fact this requires a deep dive in the docs to answer (just did this to help a new user)\r\n* How does this work for larger than memory data or distributed data? ... (unanswered)\r\n* How do I deploy Dask on my local HPC env or in the cloud? Answered in \"How To\". Maybe we should rename to \"Deployment\"?\r\n* What should I watch out for? \"Best Practices\" should go here\r\n* Where should I go if I have more questions? Maybe have an \"Additional Resources\" section with \"Talks Tutorials\", \"FAQ\", links to GH, Discourse, Stack Overflow, etc.\r\n\r\nSorry if this comes off as overly opinionated. Just thinking through how we can improve this when trying to leverage this info myself to share with someone else. Please feel free to share other thoughts :)",
