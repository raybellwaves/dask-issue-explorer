        "body": "Thanks for the report @Dobatymo, I'm able to reproduce. It looks like our current `to_hdf5` implementation requires known chunk sizes. Since `da.argwhere` is lazily evaluated, we don't know ahead of time what the array chunks will be. It triggers a computation, but the `compute_chunk_sizes()` method might come in handy here. Something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nout.compute_chunk_sizes().to_hdf5(\"out.hdf5\", \"/out\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this isn't a super helpful error message. We should raise a more informative error like we do in `to_zarr`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dask/dask/blob/49e5142577df6ba7b8695487aa18bac1b1c980ad/dask/array/core.py#L3658-L3662\r\n\r\n",
