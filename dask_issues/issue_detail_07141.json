    "body": "Users are sometimes caught off guard when they have a computation that works well and then add a new step which results in an overall computation with very different performance characteristics. For example, converting a CSV dataset to a parquet dataset\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.dataframe ass dd\r\n\r\nddf = dd.read_csv(...)\r\nddf.to_parquet(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nis easily paralizable. However, adding a `set_index` operation in the middle\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask.dataframe ass dd\r\n\r\nddf = dd.read_csv(...)\r\nddf = ddf.set_index(...)\r\nddf.to_parquet(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan impact performance significantly.\r\n\r\nThere are other operations like \r\n\r\n- `DataFrame.map_partitions` is easily paralizable\r\n- `DataFrame.drop_duplicates` (and other methods which internally perform tree-reductions) which can produce large, interesting graph structures\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we had a visualization to communicate performance characteristics of various operations to users. For example, a graphviz-style plot at the `HighLevelGraph` `Layer` level where `set_index` layers are red and `map_paritions` layers are green. \r\n\r\ncc @jsignell @jacobtomlinson @rjzamora who may have an interest in thinking about visualizations ",
