Meaningfully visualizing very large graphs is a *hard problem*.  \r\n\r\nHowever, while we can't visualize full dask graphs, we might be able to build synopses graphs and visualize those.  In particular, we may be able to take advantage of Dask's naming scheme to show connections between groups of tasks.  Presumably line widths and node sizes/shapes could be used to fill in some of the dropped information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if we can flesh out a good way to construct and visualize these on the fly then we may be able to get something live running on Bokeh.  This is probably secondary to just visualizing things statically though.\r\n\r\ncc @eriknw , who just gave a cool talk/demo about visualizing graphs",
