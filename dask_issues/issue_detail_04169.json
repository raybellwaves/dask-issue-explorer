    "body": "It seems the current hashing strategy of hashing all NumPy array contents has bitten a few users and is generally felt as surprising. Given the number of times `da.asarray` ends up being called to ensure constraints are met, this can be quite surprising for users. Would suggest that we either change the default hashing behavior or just turn it off.\r\n\r\nAs an initial suggestion about how we can change it, would try using `id` on the NumPy array to inform its hash. This is probably unique enough for most cases and we can be pretty sure that cases where that key shows up the NumPy array still exists in our graph.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",
