    "body": "Follow up work to https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7595#pullrequestreview-670702731\r\n> Follow-up work could include:\r\n> - computing layer length without materialization\r\n\r\nWe want to do this because `len()` is called a lot (even accidentally, since it gets called whenever the HTML representation of a dask array is shown). It's not good that it causes unwanted materialization of the graph.\r\n\r\nHere's some initial thoughts (see discussion here https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/7595#discussion_r627194025)\r\n> @gjoseph92 made an excellent point earlier that `__len__` and `__iter__` will materialize the whole task graph, and this is all too easy to do accidentally (eg: `_repr_html()` calls `__len__`).\r\n> \r\n> When I talked about this with Ian, we were not quite sure how to calculate the number of keys in the dictionary *a priori*. That's very easy to know with `map_blocks`, but harder to work out with `map_overlap`. The number of tasks depends on lots of things, including:\r\n> * the number of chunks in the array\r\n> * how those chunks are arranged together (is it a line of chunks, is it lots of little squares making up a bigger square)\r\n> * the overlap depth in pixels (and this seems to change it in really weird ways)\r\n> * the boundary conditions (None, reflect, periodic, nearest, constant)\r\n> \r\n> It's probably not an intractable problem, but it's not straightforward. Any advice is appreciated.\r\n\r\n> I thought I'd work it out if I just sat down and spent a bit of focused time thinking about it, but nope I can't work out the logic.\r\n> \r\n> I find it especially odd that the number of dictionary keys *decreases* like it hits a some kind of a cliff as you increase the overlap depth:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\n\r\nx = da.from_array(np.random.random((10,10)), chunks=(5,5))\r\n\r\nresult1 = x.map_blocks(lambda x: x)\r\nprint(len(result1.dask))\r\n# 8\r\n\r\nresult2 = x.map_overlap(lambda x: x, depth=2, boundary='None')\r\nprint(len(result2.dask))\r\n# 166\r\n\r\nresult3 = x.map_overlap(lambda x: x, depth=7, boundary='None')\r\nprint(len(result3.dask))\r\n# 83\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeepak points out:\r\n\r\n\r\n>>  I find it especially odd that the number of dictionary keys decreases like it hits a some kind of a cliff as you increase the overlap depth:\r\n\r\n> This is because depth=7 > chunksize=5. So map_overlap rechunks to chunksize=7. For any number \u2264 5, the number of tasks is 166. For any number > 5, the number of tasks is 83.\r\n",
