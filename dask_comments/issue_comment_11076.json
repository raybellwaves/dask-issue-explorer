In particular, with this `assert` it break the following test *dask/array/tests/test_slicing.py::test_take_along_axis__indexing_twice_same_1darray*\r\n- I removed the `meta` argument passed in `blockwise` as it was a sparse array. I suspect it some sort of optimization to give blockwise what is the expected shape but it's not really documented.\r\n- Also some variable renaming and added types, docs and integration tests.",
