    "body": "**Feature Request:** Couldn't `head()` (and perhaps also `tail()`) return early?\r\n\r\nI've a largish dataset that I'm building a script against. I've sampled a few tens of thousands of records to accelerate development while having something meaningful to work on, and I'm using `apply()` to populate a few extra columns based on `urlsplit`. (Aside: this might not be the optimal way; if there is a better one, kindly let me know in a comment.)\r\n\r\nWhile testing the script, I figured I'd use head() at the very end of the pipeline (rather than before, since that would return a Pandas dataframe and I'd like to make sure I don't run into Dash incompatibilities).\r\n\r\nIt seems that Dash applies the function to the whole sample regardless. Couldn't it bail early instead, propagate the head call to each partition or something so they return as soon as they found enough records?\r\n\r\n(The temporary workaround is of course to create an even smaller sample in the meanwhile.)",
