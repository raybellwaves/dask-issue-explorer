    "body": "This is a general question but is more focused on lower-level dask development so I figured I'd ask it here. This has to do with the recent `_meta` changes from #2977, #4543, and others from @mrocklin @shoyer and @pentschev.\r\n\r\nStarting with dask 2.0, some of my tests on my Satpy library are failing because I was checking how often my `map_blocks`'d function was being called. To determine the meta information, the function is now being called once for meta and once for actual usage from what I can tell.\r\n\r\nSo my main question is, is it possible to provide keyword arguments to `map_blocks` to say \"this is the array type that will be returned by this function\" or could it be changed to default to the type of the input arrays? Is there some way to skip this meta generation step? Would this interfere with the sparse/masked array support?\r\n\r\nRelevant source code: https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/master/dask/array/utils.py#L118-L133",
