        "body": "I just had a realization for a (possibly hacky) way to improve import time when validation is not needed, but still allow for validation in the usual case. You/we could use the `__debug__` flag:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#debug__\r\n\r\nwhich would allow you to only do validation in the default execution case, but if users were concerned about import time they could run their code with `python -O my_script.py` and dask would then not validate the dask configuration.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to throw this out there as an option for having the \"best\" of both worlds.",
