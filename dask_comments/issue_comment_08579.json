        "body": "Thanks for raising this issue @alcinos you are exactly correct in your diagnosis. In particular I was hoping that it would be possible to workaround this issue by providing dask with more information about what the dataframe looks like. You can do this by setting `_meta` like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nddf._meta = ddf.head()\r\n```\r\nAfter you set the meta you'll see that you can do addition on the whole dataframe:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprint((ddf + ddf).compute())\r\nprint((ddf + 4).compute())\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately that does not seem to affect the `_meta` of the series once you get it `ddf[\"arrays\"]`. I'll keep thinking about it.",
