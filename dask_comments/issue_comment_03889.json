Depending on cluster use, resolving this issue could lead to scale method never returning, or returning at a ressource optimum that could decay right after depending on jobs start time and walltime. Different outcome, but mainly same concerns as described above.\r\n\r\nThe only way to solve this with dask-jobqueue would be to make it able to launch multi-node jobs with worker on it. But currently we've agreed on it being out of the scope of dask-jobqueue.",
