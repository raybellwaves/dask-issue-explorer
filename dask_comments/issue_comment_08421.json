This is a bug, but there aren't real performance implications when a dask dataframe contains a single partition, so it might not be too big a deal.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of multiple partitions succeeding at not sorting:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nddf = from_pandas(pd.concat([df, df]), npartitions=2)\r\nddf.groupby(\"HASH\", sort=False).last().compute()\r\n```",
