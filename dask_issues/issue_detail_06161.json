    "body": "Dask currently doesn't have build in `nlargest` groupby aggregation. There are examples of groupby-apply pattern used for this problem ([example_1](https://github.com/h2oai/db-benchmark/blob/master/dask/groupby-dask.py#L238) and [example_2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47227874/is-there-a-way-to-get-the-nlargest-items-per-group-in-dask)), afaiu this can be efficiently solved as a groupby aggregation using panda's `nlargest`.
