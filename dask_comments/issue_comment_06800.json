        "body": " Thanks for the suggestion.  As in the code comment, I'm actually trying to gather many lists of futures in worker function (1 list for a dataset, the worker function is a training function that accepts multiple validation datasets, and each dataset contains multiple fields like labels, weights etc).  The MRE  here is impractical as it graps the whole dataset, and only used for creating a simplest example.  Also some other parameters are passed into the training function.  I can try refactoring the code to use submit instead, but might blow things up with the complexity.",
