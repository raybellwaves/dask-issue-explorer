    "body": "Came across this when working on https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/4347 . The new annotations machinery is attached to high level graph `Layer`s. However, in the optimization step, layers can be rewritten, and new layers can lose their annotations. This can especially cause unintended effects when these annotation affect scheduling/execution (as is the case when specifying workers, priority, retries, etc).\r\n\r\nA MWE that reproduces the issue on dask `master`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dask\r\nimport dask.array as da\r\n\r\nwith dask.annotate(foo=\"bar\"):\r\n    a = da.ones((1,1))\r\n    \r\nprint(a.__dask_graph__().layers[a.name].annotations)\r\naa, = dask.optimize(a)\r\nprint(aa.__dask_graph__().layers[aa.name].annotations)\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\n{'foo': 'bar'}\r\nNone\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps @sjperkins or @rjzamora may have some insight into the best fix here (it looks like @sjperkins may have [come across this before](https://github.com/dask/distributed/blob/eeb411e37f6ce754b800358462bf6c2a8a37f437/distributed/protocol/tests/test_highlevelgraph.py#L148-L149)?)\r\n",
