        "body": "@raybellwaves thank you for raising an issue to bring awareness about the `tqdm-dask` integration. \r\n\r\nNow looking at the links you provide, this integration seems to be on the `tqdm` end meaning `tqdm-dask` instead of `dask-tqdm` I wonder how do we handle documentation in these cases, since whenever there is an issue with the integration it will be resolved on the `tqdm` end. In the link you are suggesting to add this, you might notice that all the diagnostic tools are in the from `dask.diagnostics`.  So I'm not sure it's a good fit. \r\n\r\n@jrbourbeau @jsignell How do we handle documentation from integrations of the type `package-dask` where the integration was done on the `package` end?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
