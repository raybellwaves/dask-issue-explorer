    "body": "In many cases we read tabular data from some source modify it, and write it out to another data destination.  In this transfer we have an opportunity to tighten the data representation a bit, for example by changing dtypes or using categoricals.\r\n\r\nOften people do this by hand.  It might be nice for us to do some of this work for them based on a single pass through the data.  This might involve finding min/max of all integer columns, the approximate number of unique elements of all object dtype and integer columns, etc. and returning an appropriate dtype dict that we could optionally pass into an `asdtype` method.",
