    "body": "Setting a column as an index currently requires a full shuffle.  This is very expensive.   If the data is already sorted *and* doesn't have any repeated values between partitions, then we avoid this shuffle and instead just use the min/max values of each partition for the divisions.  This still requires a full pass through the data to find min/max values but is much cheaper than performing shuffles.\r\n\r\nHowever, very often data is *mostly sorted* with a bit of out-of-order behavior.  In these cases it would be nice to still use the existing divisions found during the min/max process but just move around those errant records that overlap in each partition to their neighbors.  This would make a common case situation *much* faster.\r\n\r\nAlso cc @TomAugspurger in case he's bored.  This was reported originally by @shughes-uk",
