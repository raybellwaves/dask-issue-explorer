    "body": "Now that we have high level graphs in our collections, we can do some more complex optimizations.  We've done a little bit of this with blockwise fusion, read_parquet and column selection, and root fusion, all of which have had really positive effects. \r\n\r\nThere is likely more that we can do here.  Some thoughts ...\r\n\r\n-  Fuse column selection with other kinds of data access, like read_csv or ORC\r\n-  Pass slicing through some blockwise operations in Dask array (a long-held request by @shoyer)\r\n-  Optimize the subgraph callables in blockwise with Numba (or something else) for dask array to avoid memory copies and maybe reduce serialization time\r\n-  Swap around Joins and filters and column access\r\n-  ...\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a current maintainer consider these options, guess how long they would take, and see what makes sense to do short term",
