If folks happen upon this issue and want Lance support I recommend adding a \ud83d\udc4d to the opening comment.\r\n\r\nUntil then, it's also pretty easy to create a `dask-foo` package that adds support as a third party library. This is, for example, what we did with [dask-snowflake](https://github.com/coiled/dask-snowflake).  Once third party packages get enough use outside of the main repository then it's easy to bring them in with confidence.",
