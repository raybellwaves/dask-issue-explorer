        "body": "The s3fs instance should be recreated from the arguments passed independently on the workers and the client - no dereferencing auth locally and sending that. That suggest that, if the same creds file exists in both places, the argument is not being forwarded correctly. In the case of read_parquet, I think we do not serialise the s3fs instance itself (which stores exactly the arguments used to create it) but send the \"storage_options\" along in the graph.\r\n\r\nThat piece of documentation is clearly out of data, since s3fs uses (aio)botocore, not boto3, which accounts for profile_name->profile.",
