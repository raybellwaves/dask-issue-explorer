The issue is really ask to document what happens when the `name` is unspecified or has a default value.\r\n\r\nEdit: Put another way if I have some array-like object that I would like to pass to `from_array` so I can use it with Dask, how does Dask decide to construct a `name` for that object and how might implementing `__dask_tokenize__` or similar influence that process?",
