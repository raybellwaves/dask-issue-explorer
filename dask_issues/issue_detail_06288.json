    "body": "Hi, I would like to use dask.delayed on a sparse TileDB array like described here:\r\nhttps://docs.tiledb.com/dask/tiledb-with-dask-delayed\r\n\r\nDue to the sparse nature of my array (shape is `[3x10^9, 3x10^9, 7000]`), dividing the dataset into separate chunks and loading them into memory is quite wasteful to impossible.\r\nInstead, I would like to make use of the fancy slicing capabilities of TileDB.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have a custom Dask delayed object that pushes down slicing to the underlying array?\r\n\r\n------\r\n**EDIT to be more concrete:**\r\nWhat happens when I do the following: \r\n```\r\nx = dask.array.from_array(tdb, chunks=(1000,))[:1000]\r\ny = x[:100]\r\nz = y[:10]\r\n```\r\nDoes Dask then call `tdb[:10]` or does it call `tdb[:1000][:100][:10]`?",
