We've found a reproducible 'test case' on EL9 hosts, but ... for some reason _only_ in subdirectories, not in the top level mount. \r\n\r\nBut the failure scenario is fairly straightforward so we can reproduce it, and it seems to be something happening in kernel space - with rpcdebug enabled we get nfs_revalidate_inode failures \r\n\r\n`Apr 24 10:46:50 build-2 kernel: nfs_revalidate_inode: (0:56/3839636522) getattr failed, error=-512`\r\n\r\nI know it's a few years later, but this is the most relevant 'hit' when trying to look for related issues.  It didn't seem to be specifically related to dask though - it was reproducible with 'just' spinning \r\n`multiprocessing.Pool(10)`.\r\n\r\nJust ... non trivial to trace, as the failure seems to happen in kernel space.
