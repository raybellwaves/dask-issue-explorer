    "body": "I'm curious what folks would think about adding use case-specific pages to the Dask docs. Specifically, I was thinking about pages for machine learning and workflow orchestration where there is an especially broad ecosystem of libraries that you can use with Dask, but it'd be hard to find these by looking through the Dask docs. Maybe there are other good use cases too.\r\nI'm not quite sure how these would fit into the current docs.dask.org table of contents. Some ideas:\r\n- add a new \"use cases\" category in the left TOC\r\n- create a use cases drop-down under \"how to use\" that can link out to common use cases\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nmachine learning\r\n---\r\nWe have https://ml.dask.org/, which is nice because it covers many ml-specific libraries that integrate well with Dask. A lot of this information is out of date, though, and I think it would be nice to have a single, concise page in docs.dask.org that links out to examples, relevant libraries (xgboost, lightgbm, rapids, scikit-learn, dask-ml functions that are still used/maintained), etc.\r\n\r\nworkflows/etl\r\n---\r\nI think the closest thing we have to this right now is the [Prefect example](https://examples.dask.org/applications/prefect-etl.html) in examples.dask.org. I'm imagining this page could link to using Dask with Prefect, but also other workflow orchestration tools like airflow and dagster. Maybe it also mentions things like dask-sql, dask-bigquery, [delta-rs + dask](https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/integrations/delta-lake-dask/). \r\n\r\ncc @jrbourbeau @fjetter @mrocklin @jacobtomlinson ",
